Auto carp fishing



Why?

* winter - cold freezing ?(bivvy not even good enough)
* not that much time for day session ? (need work and away from big city)
* second half of the night (00:00 - 07:00)  - what's the behzvior carp ? any bite ? how likely ? what's temperature curve? , too dangerous and cold to sleep outside （传统观念：都说冬天鱼冷些动物，新城代谢低，那么下半夜了，温度的低的时候，会不会有草鲤鱼上钩了？）
* free water ? big lake nature water  ( not small pond or paid fishery or syndicate)
* test complext bait or chemicals ? (magots for winter, boillet for summer ?) - corn (nothhing more, just corn)


My angling background:  pole fishing but not that much expierence, no ice in winter

in china, pole fish is the prevailing fish style. People like the feeling of fish's pwoer transmiting via line /rod all the way to the hand.(tremors). It is like a monster on your pole and feel of fighting with the fish is so wicked and satisfying when I got a grass carp  like 7-8 lb using 5.4 meters long pole and sweet corn.

reservoirs - The lake is very big like hundreds of acres. no one is feeding those fish, the fish is pretty much on its own, so the density is kinda low, not like high-stocked recreational fishery or syndicate. The local fishery resource in China, in general, is pretty bad. Some people uses all kinds of destructive fishing practices to catch the fish - e.g - electro、net of mesh with small hole、firecrackers. In nature water, the fishery resource is mostly damaged to a extent that fish that with weight over 1.5Kg ~ 2.5KG could be called - BIG size fish. There are some fish with weight over 20kg - 50kg (last time, one of my friend caught a carp fish with 12KG using pole rod in reservoir), but that's pretty rare. The type of carp here is almost all grass/common with super super rarely you could get a mirror, let alone any black/scaly carp type.

Here is some image in the lake. For big fish, people are angling with 8.1 meters - 10 meter long pole rod, prefeed/bait with fermented corns like every day in the same swim of the lake, then fish at the that day. For samll fish, 2.7m, 3.6m, 4.5m is pretty common. They try to fish further away from the bank at the side closing to the mountains - which is much deeper comparing to the opposite shallow side.

By talking with local anglers , they said the big fish is very hard to catch, usually they could caught one , bigger one after several days of waiting.  They need prefeed regulary with large mount of corn(fermented, homemade or bought ), extremely patient when fishing(long time of boring wait for the bite)、also extremely concentraction on the bobble floater. But once they got the bite, the feeling is so rewarding that previous efforts and boring wating is allll worthy it. Esp for pole fishing, picking up the rod、 jerking the line 、 pull it hard and setting the hook when you saw the marker float suddely dipped in then play/fight the fish, the feeling of tremors pass through the line,  adrenaline inside you,  that  is most exciting part of angling.

However fishing with rods and reels has a great adavnage for big size fish over fishing with pole. It could cast out a longer distance and possibly reach out to more fishes. Another important advice from veteran anglers is that you better pick a quiet time to fish as they are spooky and sensitive to any noise from the bank.

I still remember when I was a kid, I use self-made bamboo pole and earthworm that digged out of my backyard to catch fish which is pretty effective and simple. Nowdays it is jaw-dropping to know that fishing gears and equiments are getting so complicted and segemnted,coming with so many variations. Take a look at the pole fish gears in China and correspondings in West:

For pole fishing: A 7.2 meter telescopic pole is at least 300 RMB for moderate quality, 1000RMB0-2000RMB for good ones.They are tons of components and accessories: [fishing platform](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002382124941.html)、[multifunctional fishing box](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003307267441.html)、[fishing bucket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000096264484.html)、[fishing chair](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003186497852.html)、[fish umbrella/brolly](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002868486443.html)、fishing bag etc.

Those gears add up lots of weight and they are not easy to carry around. Look the mountains and rice field around that revoriro, I'm pretty sure by the time I got to the bank, I'm already exhausted. I thought the chinese way is somehow maximalistic. Guess what? Western carp fish is just a little bit more maximalistic :) 

图片 - 帐篷 咖啡 独轮车

A wheelbarrow - I thought angling is about minimlistic and keep it simple, until some Fox/Korda/Nash/Gardner/Mainline angler of carp fish comes with a wheelbarrow and point to all kindas gears(mat、bivvy、CAMO COOL BAGS, bait belts, coffee maker、tea press、kettle、stove、dinner set and cookare sets etc) inside it smirking and saying:  "oh my gawd, dear comrade，my young boke, how dare you? I'm the true minimalist with just one item".

Well, based on my coding experice, plus some insiprations from other areas like playing basketball/learning Spanish etc, the impluse- a intense emtion - of using or adopting new tech or langeuage or framework, or imitating whatever those masters use in videos, could be served as a clue to remind you whether you have a good picture and understanding over it without falling into traps of tunnel vision effect. You just need to be aware of that and you have options to step back to study basics 、 break big one into small pieces、figure out those piece roughly, then back to high level again to priortize. High priority ones is probably not that thrilling like low priority ones(Think about the letter `R` in Spanish - that's like the least important part for any beginners yet most people will simply give up learning spanish just because they can't pronunciate it after a couple of times trying).

To find someones' balance point between the simplicity and pureness of joy from primitivism(lack of options- scarcity) and more possiblities yet more expensive&cumbersome from commericials(overwhelmed - surplus) is kinda ideal but difficult - you need weigh the pros and cons through trial and error.

Hence i want to get my hands dirty as simple and economical as possible, no need for much comfort as it is non-attended hence no alarm、boat、bivvy、chair、brolly、coffee maker.... and barrow&trolley. The basic fish tackle combo is 2.7 meter rod($4~24RMB)、5000 reel($3-$4~20RMB)、100 meter long braide fishing line of size 6($2~12RMB).In the following sections, I will break down on what fishing strategy I 'gonna use for my fishing scernario and you could see why I choose that combo.



## Do my homeowrk

conditions: 

* reservoir : low stocked big nature water - still water
* target: 1.5KG - 15KG 
* time:  1-2 days consecutive
* unmanned/unattended:  passive and automatical
* baid/feed strategy: setup once, no middle of add more baiting/feeding 
* secretiveness:  detecting device should be small enough to be camouflaged and not easily be able to spot
* mobility : device and whole fish tackle should be easily to be assemble or dis-assemble
* setup: first cast out with rod and reel; then pull main line out of reel and rod and attatch to tent peg; carefully setup trigger between the main line and device.

Quick Summary: setup feeder/bait, cast out and link with tent pegs,  setup the bite alarm device, hook the trigger between mainline and device.  Leave it for 1-2 days. When got bite from fish,  the strength will trigger alarm, hence give a call to my phone so that I could just go there and pickup and land the fish. But we also need some hearbeat to know that device is running properly. Every one minutes,  it send a http request to my backend which log its timstamp and whether it got triggered or not.  With this data,  later we could analyze what time it got bite and what temperature from online historical weather data.


### Angling strategy

*A beard well lathered is half shaved.* It is always good to draw some inspiration from existing carp fishing strategys like pole fishing and carp fishing. 

**Swim/Location**: The first thing you need is to analyze the terrian of where you fish - read water. Either take a walk aroud the water area, or searching its google map statelite image, or asking from local angler, just try figure out the general terrin of water you're gonna fish. No rush to drop you rods. For picking the right swim, it is always good to have direct eye sight of fish rollover or buble of stiring mud. And most of time, you want to stay away from those with high angling pressures from the bank. In winter, generaly you want your fish spot is closing to snags or something structure(weed beds、fallen trees 、overhanging vegetation or rocks) that provide safer places to hide for a school of fish instead of open water.

(here is the lake genenral shape ) 标识点位 钓点

The left side is the deep water area with mountains sliding into water very sharply, that right side is kinda shallow  full of debris left from submerged rice field. Most poeple will pick the left side with deeper open-water and less snags but rocky at the margin, and I barely see anyone fishing on the rice field side.  But I decided to go from the rice fields, the reasons are:  1. Even though it has snags like debris of rotten rice plants,  it doesn't do that much damage comparing to rocky strucuture , considering it is unmanned and unattended. When fish got the bite, felt the pain, it is gonna drag the line to whereever it felt safe - which mostly is full of snags or deep water so to say. A rocky structure would be much easier to cut the line due to its sharpness than some softy rotten debris could.  2. Helicopter or chod rig could help lift up the hook from lake bed and present nicely without being buried in the debris  -  interestinly I have never seen anyone of pole fish use chod rig or sort of before.

**Depth**: Another key is to select appropriate water depth for fishing spot. Often we've heard people saying: "The deeper the better", for deep water could hide big size fish. Also some says " You should pick margins - where shallow water meets deeper water - a sharp drop-off or deep channel". Some says "in winter/autumn, go for deep, in spring&summer, go for shallow". This is just very confusing. After talked with some local angler with different level's angling experience, pretty much everyone gives  different opinons - there is just no consensus.  Here is a quick comparison from what they say:

| shallow water              | deep water         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| more food                  | less food          |
| not that safer, more noisy | Safer, quieter     |
| high oxygen content        | low oxygen content |
| warm                       | cold               |

Rule of thumb: water temperature and oxgen content is two key factors dictating fish feed activity . While the last one about water temperature, there are kinda opposite for summer and winter. In summer, surface of water is warm, the bottom is cold; but in winter, vice versa.*On the one* hand,  It looks like every saying has its right points, but on the other hand, it seems it somehow contradicts with others. So the middle water column (the one shallow meets deeper) is the correct one to go ?  This just intrigued me - I spent some time reseaching and watched lots of carp fish videos of both China and outside China.

(Fishery genemry IFishman)

Talk is cheap. Show me the code. 

Here is some graphcs that germany fishery lab did on a nature water pond/lake. They marked different types of fish with different electronic instrument(show in different colors), track their signals of activity across the whole year and got some interesting data. For example, in winter, you might think the fish will hide in the deepest part of lake, but it turns out they all huddle together on the shallow border(reminiscence of stock operator - oops, no - winter time of elementary school - we all huddle togher at the corner of classroom in a american football way). Another interesting observation,  we might think as the temperature and oxygen levels drops to the lowest point during the midnight, to that extent, that  fish will simply stop all kindas activity -  statue of sluggish. However the graphic shows they actually are still moving around during what we perceived as "the worst time of day".  That just blows my mind.

That just shows how we project what we think on behalf of the fish. What you think fish should do != what fish does on its own. You can't know what fish is thinking(suppose it has a thinking in whatever you might named it  - dao/god/natura naturans), instead you could only guess from their behaviors.  To anaylze behaviors and actions,  we could borrow from Francias Bacon's scientifc method.  Namely put our prejudices 、preconception and old sayings/claims under inspection, careful observation on the fact,   tabulation and classification on factors that possibly lead to the fact，setup experiments to verify etc - investigative method to form a empirical study which not based on ideas and theories. don't get me wrong，I'm not saying that you should overwhelm yourself with everything by yourself (the earth is flat)- some you could stand on the shoulder of gaint.  A good way is to identify what's [hard science and soft science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science).  Angling is pretty much like sociology and economics, it is very hard to do a controlled experiment - there are simply too many factors involved and isolation becames pretty much impossilbe to do. You could angle with same bait/same fish tackle, in same swim , in same season and pretty much same sunny day, same temperature/wind from weather report, but very likely you have different results - to say the least - maybe a full fishing keepnet or just blank - never you got same result.

From my experience and ponder-over, sometimes , as angler, maybe we need shift our perspective from chasing after certaintiy(conventional wisdom) to getting along with probability and statistics - i.e - uncertaninty. I will elaborate more on this in following secions.

However shifted to thinking in terms of probabiliy and statistics, doesn't mean  you dont' wahter you want to or just being clueless like headless chicken or dont need any logic and reasoning. Well, quite to the contrary, you need do your homework(If there is one silverbullet) like what Joel Greenblat said in [<<The Little Book That Beats the Market>>](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Still-Beats-Market/dp/0470624159) -  it requires careful design the experiment based on as much as possibly pre-collected data at your hand, welly and thourlghy analyzed , then took a reasonable guess, apply it via some trial and error. (ps: well, you just angle for first couple of times,  you might got the beginner's luck - you could laught at me - but hey bloke - your sample size is too small...)

In my case, the depth of the mountain side is like 5-6 meters deep from about 4-5 meters close to bank. It could even deeper farther way. On the other side , the shallow side, is like 2-3 meters deep from 4-5 meters - since I only do pole fish  and never use surf rod bebfore. I have no idea bout about what's depth of 20-30 - 50 meters away. Given what I know, it looks 3-8 meters depth could be a good ballkpark for winter from shallow side to try out first.



**Distance**

Along the previsouly mentioned old saying "The deeper the better", there is another corresponding old saying "The further the better" for casting. Conventional wisdom or those old sayings are good start point at first,  but never it shall be treated as something like doctrine. Those sayings are generally short , high condensed, and concise abstractions , well, at the sacrifice of leaving out full context and details of specific cases. They are best served as guidance(outward), and you need to dig it out by yourself(inward) - Turning outward guidances into intward experience. As Bruce Lee says in <<Enter the dragon>>：

>  "Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!"

If you're doing pole fishing, you know from probiliity perspective, the longer the rod and line, the higher chance you could catch big size fish. Why? because often the closer to bank, typically the shallower the water would be,  espec in day time, more noisy it would be - which is not a safe place for big fish(Carp is really smarter and more spooky than what you think they might be) to hide. Even so, veteran anglers still would cast out a couple of rods to test depth around the target fish spot -left,right, front or back -  to get a better idea about the lakebed terrain. This is very nature for pole fishing since it has marker floating and it is quite easy to test out the water depth from disntance of 2 meter - 10 meters. But for surf rod fishing it is little bit tricky, for it doesn't have a marker floating buit-in.  

It is not uncommon for some surf rod anglers just to rush to start fishing - cast out extremely long distance without much thought as soon as they arrived at the lake, and spend lots of time waiting on the bank, yet they didn't wanna just spend a few casts to test out the water depth and lake bed terrain of fish spot beforehand. They just go there, mount the hookbait and cast out whereever they want, then just wait like "I'm done with work on my side, it is the fish - your turn to bite".  Yes, they still coud get a bite from fish and caught it , no doubt.  But hmmm, lets take another proablbity game -  basetketball as exmaple , the goal of shooting  is to get basketball throught he hoop and score. Well think about it is the last shot - a possible buzzbeater,  there are two game plans from coache - one is Micachel Jordan or Kobe Byrant is taking the shot , if they got the cold hands(look : self-proclaimed GOAT [🐑](https://emojipedia.org/ewe/)Lebron James only got 8 points in the nba finals...) and it is highly possible for them to miss it; another is a nobody like me taking the shot, if I got the hot hand(every dog has its day), I might hit it.  But nonobyd would think I'm better than Micachel or Kobe, because they could do it consistently and with solid fundamentals of pyshican and mental - some of them is from hard-work training and desire to strieve for greatness and push theirself ot the limit . 

So just because it is a paobolity game full of randoms, it is aslo eactly why we need build our firmly well-sturcture reasonging from our experincen and observation during prepration(Cephas - lay the groundwork), setup open/continuous feedback loop during process(mieache jordan develop from early days altehic dunker -air jordan -  into an ellite fade-away jumper in his late years)，lower the expectation for the outcome - Let the chips fall where they may. And be aware of that temptation and emotion of yourself, try to know yourself better.

Then what's some fundentmtls here? cast out accuraccly . just pracice, you dont' need exact same spot,  some offset is perfectine fine - Remember it is not rock sicence.  For me, It didn't took me long to  be able to cast accurenty like 30 meter disnace with 1-3 meters radius in that vicinity.  I found it is extemly useful to record the moves of your casting in video. You could see your posture,movmenet and adjust accordingly - [The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740) - what you think of yourself is probably not what you really are.

Casting out a couple of times  also help you get a great detail on the lakebed of fish spot  - is it gravel、rocky or weedy or silty ? Flat or sharp dropoff ?  How you gonna choose right rig strategy for it. Fish might get sacred and flee away by the sound of lead hitting the water surface, but some underwater video experiment shows those fish will slowly get back to search for the food. It is not a big deal in my case, as I have lots of time and patience for it while chilling cozily out at home with heating on and drinking my Longjing/Dragon Well tea - vibe 😎🤞 :)

I have chosen the distance like 20-30 meters far away from the bank. And 2.7 meters long rod with 5000 reel did a pretty good job considering the thickness of the fihsing line(line size 8). Since my focus is on fish's nocturnal behaviors, and night is quieter than day time, also based on what I know from above depth section, hence my assumption is that big fish will be morely likely to go to shallow water that close to bank where it could have more food to feed.


## BAIT/Feeder

Basically how could we attract the fish into the swim? Well, the fish use mostly following senses to detect and indentify whehter something is good to eat or not : smell、taste、sight. Fish have a pretty good olfactory system to sense any dissolved substance in the water ,and they could recognize the smell of  amino acids and others having nutritional value. Chemoreception - They could taste, esp for carp, they sucks in a big mouth of silt and other detritus -  when they smell or feel via taste buds from their barbules, pectoral and pelvic fins of the eatable like bloodworm/corn etc - palatal taste organ in the mouth trap the food against the bottom of the mouth and expell non-food through gills(almost 90% got ejected). Also they have sensitive eyes, could see in lower light levels under the water and detetct changes in light and movement above the water - so camouflage like Rambo, anglers! However, their habit of feeding in the sediments on the bottom searching for small buried food items has required them to rely on highly developed senses of smell and taste.


Generally the feeding habit of carp is most fixed and stable like routine - eat what is plentiful - but sometime they will break it or at least try to discover new food sources. It is a dynamic process. Mostly stable-better chance, sometimes dynamic - slim chance. Consider that the reservoir which has lots of rice field/reed/mulberry tree around it, then most likely the rice/reed/mulbeery will get you better chance to get a bite consistently comparing to other food like corn that fish never see it before. On the other hand, if you prefeeding the same spot with lots of corn regularly over a long period of time, the feeding behavior of fish might change accordingly. The carp is not one-track minded, they're open to adapt their feeding habit if it works.

With those being said, it is always good to spend sometime beforehand looking at the surrounding of fishing location、talking to local angler to get a good idea about what kinda feeding/baiting feed are best for. Some anglers boast about the effectiveness of flavoured baits esp in those commercial videos - it is like the silver bullet for y'all. Touting how good the flavors or scents are with a vareity of chemicals as if it comes from some alchemist 、how pink color of boilies  performs better than yellow - `buy me you stupid angler,then you will be as wicked as me`. There are two common thought patterns:

* 1. If I feel good about it, then the fish must be feel the same like I feel, then the fish must feel good about too, hence go bite it.

* 2. It works for me for a couple of times, then it must work for you too.

The first one - induction - seems very strightforward , but with a short ponder,  shows it is flawed. The middle premise just couldn't stand. I saw lots of angler smell the bait, but come on, you need also taste the bait too, but no one did that :)  If the bait smells good, then they will think it could attract more fish than those which smells bad. Even though the way that those modlecurles trasmitting throught air is different from those tramsinting thought water, let alone different receptors betwen human being and fish, adding scents and flavors does attract the fish. but the question here is how to measure its effectiveness.`sola dosis facit venenum` - how much is approrate to be defined as a natural flvor and scent level for the fish. It has some range, isn't ?
Is it always "the more the better"? to how much it could just backfire?(Some Wu Wei wisdom from Livemore : Money is made by sitting, not trading)

Be be fair, those question are kinda difficult to find answers(or proably couldn't) and demand those "Charismatic leadership" 、 so-called carp fishing masters in the promoting videos from commerical fish tackle brands to put a disclaimer at the beginning - saying *"I'm not 100% sure about whether this fancy bait will work  - so you could buy this expensive one but it didn't work at all or even getting worse - and I just have no idea"*  - is kinda picky. But given human kinda are just natureally likes imitating as beginners, and nothging is more straightforwarnd、 intuitve and easier to reach  widely like videos , they're likly to copy what those teachter does , i.e. buy whatever tackles those masters are using and master's tackles and equiqments are damn pricy! They want to get their `hello world` running as soon as possible to get thrills, hey nobody is gonna read pages of document to get exact details of it - and I have no problem with that people are making money out of it.(Hey, I'not a contemporary cynicism and do like [franknesss from Adam Penning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLiArMvlfpg&ab_channel=CARPologyTVCarpFishing) among other carp fishing masters).

Either you dont' put up your effort and do your homework (expierment - retrospection/adjustment -expierment) and you pay with high price, or you pay with cheaper price, then put up your effort and do your homework. the second one in longer term is way more feasible/possible to have all planets aligned and hit the jackpot. Because those commerical baiting are just general abstractons by leaving out specfical details and contexts, you have to try different ones to try to match the context in your individual case: Up -> Bottom vs Bottom -> Up.

Still you can buy those branded ones, no problem , but just dont trap yourself into the mindset that you need to buy the most fancy and most expensive ones to get most bites. Fishing has a context, each is different. And context has so many factors, that baiting is just one of them and no one factor is over others by a crazy margin - if yes, then it only means it is just a snapshot. 

And that comes with the second thought pattern. They shows you the empirical success without talking about context or primary attributing factors - how carp fish uses their eyesight. Like in some video they says pink colored boilies is bettern than yellow ones and it is helping them catch more fishes - go get the pinks. But they leave out the stats like what time and what kinda of water condition in terms of visibiliy like full of sediments or clear one - those relates to the eyesight. Just because i have this empircal success, you 're gonna have the same success if you copy my fishing strategy - hmmmm?

To conclude, rice - from obeervation of rcie field ,  and feed corn (or maize) -  from local anglers,  is picked as candidates for the carp bait. Cleary I don't want wait for hours to get small fish bite , so the rice or pellets or small particles will be excluded. Since I'm gonna leave it under the water for 1-2 days, those bait shouldn't be easily dissovled or lose its liveness like live bait. So big solid particle like feed corn is a perfect fit and most important part is it is juuuust so cheap and so simple to prepare. Buy some feed corn, soak it and boil it, if you'd like - not necessary- could try experiment by adding some molasses or alcohols like Baileys or Tsingtao beer or hemp oil later.(Who knows! I have some Turmeric&Curry&Coriander&Garam masala powder left from last time trying cook indian food, and I might add those to test out)


After picked the bait for feeding, next thing is about the feeding strategy. Obiviously most reasonable one is to take little bit time to just chumming some baits to same spot every day(like one week or one month) before you really get your rods out and start fishing. But is is impossible for me as I only got 4-7 days holiday break and I really dont' want spend too much time on the bank to fish - I only got one hour break each day to go outdoors for fishing(family first) - that's exactly why I come up with an idea about auto carp fishing. To make it up, I decide to choose one fishing spot and bait there instead of moving around the lake on the bank. Here is my two cents on how to effectively attract fish in big nature water by feeding/baiting:

图片（打窝中心）

Basically we have the fish spot in the center, and feeding, i.e - corn- is evenly scattered around it forming a cricle with 3-5 meter radius. Loose chumming could possibly attract further fishes in a longer distance than precise baiting, as it could cover bigger and wider water area by its falvors and scents. Then we use pva bags or pva mesh to precisely bait right in the center this circle. Well this seems pretty ideal, the tricky part is how to get chumming like what hands can do but in a longer distance ? Slingshot、Spod、 pva bags/mesh、 gaint throwing sticks/baiting spoon even fishing bait boat couldn't do that easily.


图片- 打窝的图片和视频


In above picture and videos, that is a home-made spod with bottle and a lead. You could see that the corns inside the bottle will be detached from the lead/sinker benehter it as it is falling and is about to hit the water. Those dry corns has a lighter weigh comparing to the lead and will split out and be scattered into the water - inside a circle of 3-5 meters. The downside is the baiting inside it need to be light/dry and also it won't cast out very far away given its bad aerodynamic shape. But it fits my case - actually that's exactly my intention to not fish from a very long distance. Everything has its pros and cons, just like coding or system or archecture design, you need analyze the situation first to get a big picture,then weighs between different apporaches, prioritize and comes to a trade-off.


## Rigs 

A quick recap on the fish tackles : 2.7 meters long rod、5000 reel、braided line with size of 8 and 8 strands、a slim bobber float(just for testing depth)、80g~2.8oz sinker、 hair rig of big size 4 circle hook with pop-ups buoyant bait、smaller size 7 Izu Iseni hook for bottom bait with feed corn. To be honest, I have some doubt on using fake bait like plastic corn as bait.

Only middle part of China in Sichuan and Chongqing use similar fake bait, but not my hometown or province - like never. Most people here rarely use any kinda pop-ups bait or circle hook, instead they are inclined to use bottom bait with iseni hook for big-size fish. For people fishing with pole, they only use maximum two hooks for each. However for people fishing with rod and reel, they just use a fewww hooks - chinese way of understatement. Let's take a look at two most frequently used hook patterns:

 串钩 or 爆炸钩 图片
 ps1: I guess in us/uk it is called something like gang/party hooks? [(Christmas party in Downing Street while London was in strict lockdown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfTsLjdb3Mc&ab_channel=CNN) :) 
 ps2: update - later I found it is called sth like flapper or clipped down rig for sea fishing as it is illegal to have more 2 hooks for freshwater in uk?
 
The logic is pretty straightforward: more hooks more bites. Despite of the so-claimed moral superiority of using fewer hooks from some people - as long as it doesn't voilate the local regulations, I don't see any problem with that. On the flip side of more hooks is that it means hooks has higher chances getting trapped in snags or structure forms like rocks/reefs/weed when angler cast out or play the fish. If you use it in open water which has less snags and have a pretty good understanding on the condition of the lakebed, then go for it. But I have mountain reserovir with lots of snags like rocks and weed, plus a design of non-attended angling, so multi-hooks seems not a good option. Ideally one hook but as I said, I never use pop-up bait with fake corn before , so I want to do a experiment and compare it with common bottom bait with feed corn side by side. Even though techniquly fish is not `eating` the fake plastic corn but more like `chewing` - they just try out the possible food through their mouth and expell it out, I'm still very curious to just, by myself, to catch some fishes in order to test out popular saying:  "If I dont' eat plastics, how come fish will eat it ?"

Apart from adding more hooks to increase the odds, adding more rods could also get greater chance - 3 rods looks good.

保证鱼不容脱钩发力

* 泄力 - 比如弹簧 或者橡皮筋 rubber band or fabric latex
* 铅坠 - 活动 - 这样鱼不会那么会摆动
* 缓冲 - 加多10米的线在岸上 冬天鱼的活力没那么好 metabolism
* open water, less snags or structure (rock formations/too much weedy)
