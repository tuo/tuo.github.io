Auto carp fishing



Why?

* winter - cold freezing ?(bivvy not even good enough)
* not that much time for day session ? (need work and away from big city)
* second part of night (00:00 - 07:00)  - what's the behzvior carp ? any bite ? how likely ? what's temperature curve? , too dangerous and cold to sleep outside
* free water ? big lake nature water  ( not small pond or paid fishery or syndicate)
* complext bait or chemicals ? (magots for winter, boillet for summer ?) - corn (nothhing more, just corn)

My case: background with pole fishing but not that much expierence, no ice in winter

in china, pole fish is the prevailing fish style. people like the feeling of fish's pwoer transmiting via line /rod all the way to the hand.(tremors). The pole they 're using from 3.6 to 10 meters, if you go small fish like Crucian carp.

AUTOMATICALY VS normal CPAR DIALY SESION

TIME：long(1-2days) vs short

BAIT/PRE FEEDER: slow(last longer) - baiting method is different(chumming and laser focus/precise) vs fast

MODEL : passsive(no angler nearby) vs active()

FISHIN DISTANCE: short vs long (why counterintuitive)



open water(less snags) + shallow water(not always deepest) + close to bank 

day time : hiding the deep water or near snags like structure of rocks/reefs (safety)  - noisy 

night time: go to the shadllow water (close to bank) to get food - quiet



1. why open water

图片（选址）

no man is constant checking it , could happen in the midnight or sometime you're sleeping, and it could some time for you to go the swim/bank. 

Fish could drag the lines/hooks anywhere that fish feel safe. And most likely coudl be one with snags, like rocks/reefs/.

you need to ensure thereis not much sngas around there; second you need ensure it won't cause significate pain for the fish, liek you could just drop the sinker so it won't add too much burden/pain to the fish (little resisitance(drop off sinker))



2.  shallow water(not always deepest)s

deepeest is the best ?

 It is important to see that the big carp are not set in the deepest part of the lake.

Now comes December - the carp start again shortly before St. Nicholas. What on earth are the carp doing on the shallow border, and why aren't they at the deepest point in the western basin?



Winter the water is cold, yeah, it got deeper mostly it si warmer. but there is another case like pile of reefs, their termp is higher that open water. shallow water generally has more food compaing to deep water. so it need has some depth but not that much deeper needed. based on the lake you fish, rule of thumb would 3-8 meters.

3. close to the bank 

​	Here comes antoher conventional thought. YOu awalys need to fish furthest possile, as if the big fish is hiding in the center of the lake. Yes, somehow make senese, but not that much.  YOU need ask question first: where possile the fish is in this particular lake or pond ?

Assess the terrain and lake's condition , like where it gots most trees , where it go the reefs or farms or whatever. what ttime and termparua/season you're fishing, if is summer, probably it won' matter much as fish is very active; in winter, you mostly want find snags or reefs (that possiblly more inclined to be close to the bank). SO find the spot, then cast it.



The day session you probably need const looking for signs of carp activity like rollover or direct eyesight, or bubble ereged from water, sometime climb up and dowsn to get some peeks where they are.

But in my case, that's not every helpful as the water is soooo big. I choose to close to bank for some reasons, during the night, the  surrounding could be quiet, fish are more likely staying the area that close to the bank for food.



4 multi hooks(stinger-hook?) rig or single hook rig

Here, in china, mostly angler using 串钩 or 爆炸钩 - i.e multi rigs along the lines-  to increase the chances to catch the fish. But that comes with problem: it is very easy for their hooks to get trapped with rocks or reefs/snags when they casting out or they drag the fish after got a bite. 

https://fishingmagic.com/forums/threads/more-than-one-hook.239744/

I guess differences we fishing mostly for pot & recreactonal, mostly people lives not close to sea. but like cpar fishing, mostly poplar in uk, they have more sea fishes with less bones like freshwater fishes.

The biggest things I can see against using two hooks is the flailing hook that can get snagged when playing the fish and there is also the thing in if you get a break off...a fish would stand more of a chance in getting caught up we go to the extent of lead clips weak links etc....why would anyone want to add this as a factor???



If you don't like the idea of two hook rigs then don't use them, but don't try to claim some sort of moral superiority for your choice.



一般淡水鱼垂钓 coarse fishing

bailey



for secreteiveness:

* no rod
* device for detecting(bite alarm) https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=carp+fishing+alarm&oq=carp+fishing+alarm&aqs=chrome..69i57.5996j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8



setup rod/bait/feeder, setup the bite alarm device, hook those two, wait for 1-2 days, when got fish,  bite alarm device could give a call to my phone so that I could just go there and pickup and land the fish. well, every one minutes, send acc,x,y,z and tmeratorat to my backend , so that I could debug and check what's the temparuate looks liek and what time the fish got bite, to build a personal and model for fish's behavior.

Fishing is the probablity game, very much like investing in stock market.

As we shall see, the difference is one of emphasis and execution rather than of principle. Aristotle favors the discussion of general principles that can be arrived at on the basis of an intuitive grasp of natures, while Bacon stresses the importance of slow and careful induction from specific cases.
