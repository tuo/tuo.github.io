Auto carp fishing



Why?

* winter - cold freezing ?(bivvy not even good enough)
* not that much time for day session ? (need work and away from big city)
* second part of night (00:00 - 07:00)  - what's the behzvior carp ? any bite ? how likely ? what's temperature curve? , too dangerous and cold to sleep outside
* free water ? big lake nature water  ( not small pond or paid fishery or syndicate)
* complext bait or chemicals ? (magots for winter, boillet for summer ?) - corn (nothhing more, just corn)

My case: background with pole fishing but not that much expierence, no ice in winter

in china, pole fish is the prevailing fish style. people like the feeling of fish's pwoer transmiting via line /rod all the way to the hand.(tremors). The pole they 're using from 3.6 to 10 meters, if you go small fish like Crucian carp.

reservoirs - The lake is very big like hundreds of acres. no one is feeding those fish, the fish is pretty much on its own, so the density is kinda low, not like high-stocked recreational fishery or syndicate.

Here is some image in the lake, people are angling with 8.1 meters - 10 meter long pole rod, prefeed/bait with fermented corns like every day in the same swim of the lake, then fish at the that day. They try to fish further away from the bank at the side closing to the mountains - which is much deeper comparing to the opposite shallow side.

By talking with local anglers, they said the big fish is very hard to catch, usually they could caught one , bigger one after several days of waiting.  They need prefeed regulary with large mount of corn(fermented, homemade or bought ), extremely patient when fishing(long time of boring wait for the bite)、also extremely concentraction on the sign change of marker float . But once they got the bite, the feeling is so rewarding that previous efforts and boring wating is allll worthy it. Esp for pole fishing, picking up the rod、 jerking the line 、 pull it hard and setting the hook when you saw the marker float suddely dipped in then play/fight the fish, the feeling of tremors pass through the line,  adrenaline inside you,  that  is most exciting part of angling.



Reason people despise or look down the one using Rod（海竿或lure) are (here is link from angler tieba, sth like Angler subreddt(https://tieba.baidu.com/p/6348235004?red_tag=3265959682#128408796299l):

* SurfRod is passive, like setup, leave it then just wait for the alarm. one no need to always look at the marker float and there are lots of tricks on what kinda of marker float's movement relating to fish's behavior and what timing is the proper to pick up rod and jerk it ; second no setting the hook just wait util rod bell sound, the feel of hook set is missing .
* Pole fish when play fish is much harder and much intensive comparing to 海竿, becase they dont' have spooler/reels. They got higher chance of losing the fish , i.e.g not being able to land the fish, but that difficulit means you 're gonna put lots of work and concentraion for this phase (you hhave no way to backdown like Caesar crossing Rubicon river ).That dedication leads to greater satisfiction and apprecation for the fish.
* peple genreately setup lots of rod at one row like ( 3 ,4, 5,6 ..8) and multiple hooks in one rig, that sounds just for caughting the fish not for the fun of fishing process (爆炸钩创狗 - moral superiority); while pole fish you only have one or two rod(one sshorter rod for small fish, one longer rod for big fish) - each max only has two hooks
* 

Pole fish involve smore dedication / concentraction /complex technique/tricks and shorter feedback loop during the angling  comparing to the Rod fish, which leads to why most people think that pole fishing is much funnier and more interesting than rod fish.

Yeah, above those do make sense to some extent.  Different style, different kinda of fun. Since we focus on catching big fish, not small ones, it is important to layout the differences:

* waiting : both need to wait and wait for a long time.   海竿 you have bivvy or long chair to lay down comfortable. but pole fish you only got a chair, and need constantly stare at the float, it is kinda exgusting and not that comforatable.

* chances:  big fish tends to stay away from bank in daytime, so if you fish far from bank, it generally is deepr, and has a better chance to locate big fish.THe rod they're using are at least 7.2m long, could be 8.1, 9.2, 10.0 , 11 meters long. Even with lines, it could maxi get around 20 meters far(actually not that far, because the water usally is kinda deep and take out some lines), and it is pretty trick to cast out without reels. But with 海竿，you could easily cast out like 30meter at least, with good ones, like 100 meters is not that hard.

* Expense:  even the cheapest pole rod you could on taobao([奥西尼x7](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.25.23117b10Kpyfpn&id=641987583688&ns=1&abbucket=17#detail)) is gonna cost you 90-100 RMB like 15-16$.  But you could get a 2.7m rod and 5000 reels with around 45 RMB like 7-8$. With my experiment, that cheap combiniation(8 strands braided PE line 6.0/0.40mm/32KG with 100 meters long - price is 12RMB .i.e 2$) could  get me cast out like 40-50 meters in a breeze.(TODO: change to 4strands for more abrasion resistance, but no preoptimzation)

* landing fish: because you got reels and has drag, it is much easier to fight/play the fish once got bite. While if you're using Pole rod, you have pretty much fixed length line, which leaves very little room for mistake. I have seen lots of people fail to land the fish, because it cast out fully without buffer or extra room for flexibility(again conventional wisdom: the further, the better). if the fish got the bite, felt the pain, ficerly move its head, it might go striaght oppose to bank direction(the line fish and rod is like 180 degree aligned). Under this case, you might not even has a chance to pick-up your rod,  end up in  tug-of-war (in chinese拔河) - i.e. fish go that way, you go this way -  and most of time it is the angler got tumbled and have to leave out the rod from hands if line is strong enough or most likely line breaks. Either case, the fish descends into the depths and leave you stare in disbelief(哦豁oh ho - in chinese - i.e. - not so bosh/wicked cool).

casting precisly:

* limit by psychical  or line clip 

  



target: 20-25 g fish max, 



AUTOMATICALY VS normal CPAR DIALY SESION

TIME：long(1-2days) vs short

FEEDER: slow(last longer) - baiting method is different(chumming and laser focus/precise) vs fast

bait: corn vs boilet/peolliot/maggots

MODEL : passsive(no angler nearby) vs active()

FISHIN DISTANCE: short vs long (why counterintuitive)

rod: no rod vs rod 

bite alarm: automatical trigger vs normal bite alarm line trigger

agnling pressure: low always, oppose to where mostly people fishing swim



open water(less snags) + shallow water(not always deepest) + close to bank 

day time : hiding the deep water or near snags like structure of rocks/reefs (safety)  - noisy 

night time: go to the shadllow water (close to bank) to get food - quiet



1. why open water

图片（选址）

no man is constant checking it , could happen in the midnight or sometime you're sleeping, and it could some time for you to go the swim/bank. 

Fish could drag the lines/hooks anywhere that fish feel safe. And most likely coudl be one with snags, like rocks/reefs/.

you need to ensure thereis not much sngas around there; second you need ensure it won't cause significate pain for the fish, liek you could just drop the sinker so it won't add too much burden/pain to the fish (little resisitance(drop off sinker))



2.  shallow water(not always deepest)s

deepeest is the best ?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAFhejwoSM&ab_channel=IFishMan

 It is important to see that the big carp are not set in the deepest part of the lake.

Now comes December - the carp start again shortly before St. Nicholas. What on earth are the carp doing on the shallow border, and why aren't they at the deepest point in the western basin?



Winter the water is cold, yeah, it got deeper mostly it si warmer. but there is another case like pile of reefs, their termp is higher that open water. shallow water generally has more food compaing to deep water. so it need has some depth but not that much deeper needed. based on the lake you fish, rule of thumb would 3-8 meters.

3. close to the bank 

​	Here comes antoher conventional thought. YOu awalys need to fish furthest possile, as if the big fish is hiding in the center of the lake. Yes, somehow make senese, but not that much.  YOU need ask question first: where possile the fish is in this particular lake or pond ?

Assess the terrain and lake's condition , like where it gots most trees , where it go the reefs or farms or whatever. what ttime and termparua/season you're fishing, if is summer, probably it won' matter much as fish is very active; in winter, you mostly want find snags or reefs (that possiblly more inclined to be close to the bank). SO find the spot, then cast it.



The day session you probably need const looking for signs of carp activity like rollover or direct eyesight, or bubble ereged from water, sometime climb up and dowsn to get some peeks where they are.

But in my case, that's not every helpful as the water is soooo big. I choose to close to bank for some reasons, during the night, the  surrounding could be quiet, fish are more likely staying the area that close to the bank for food.



4 multi hooks(stinger-hook?) rig or single hook rig

Here, in china, mostly angler using 串钩 or 爆炸钩 - i.e multi rigs along the lines-  to increase the chances to catch the fish. But that comes with problem: it is very easy for their hooks to get trapped with rocks or reefs/snags when they casting out or they drag the fish after got a bite. 

https://fishingmagic.com/forums/threads/more-than-one-hook.239744/

I guess differences we fishing mostly for pot & recreactonal, mostly people lives not close to sea. but like cpar fishing, mostly poplar in uk, they have more sea fishes with less bones like freshwater fishes.

The biggest things I can see against using two hooks is the flailing hook that can get snagged when playing the fish and there is also the thing in if you get a break off...a fish would stand more of a chance in getting caught up we go to the extent of lead clips weak links etc....why would anyone want to add this as a factor???



If you don't like the idea of two hook rigs then don't use them, but don't try to claim some sort of moral superiority for your choice.



一般淡水鱼垂钓 coarse fishing

for secreteiveness:

* no rod
* device for detecting(bite alarm) https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=carp+fishing+alarm&oq=carp+fishing+alarm&aqs=chrome..69i57.5996j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8



setup rod/bait/feeder, setup the bite alarm device, hook those two, wait for 1-2 days, when got fish,  bite alarm device could give a call to my phone so that I could just go there and pickup and land the fish. well, every one minutes, send acc,x,y,z and tmeratorat to my backend , so that I could debug and check what's the temparuate looks liek and what time the fish got bite, to build a personal and model for fish's behavior. (ELK)

start with small/easy, not overthinking beforehead (preoptimozation ), fail fast and get feedback loop quick







Fishing is the probablity game, very much like investing in stock market.

Preparation(with efforts) + Randomneess =

As we shall see, the difference is one of emphasis and execution rather than of principle. Aristotle favors the discussion of general principles that can be arrived at on the basis of an intuitive grasp of natures, while Bacon stresses the importance of slow and careful induction from specific cases.
