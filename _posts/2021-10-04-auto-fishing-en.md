Auto carp fishing



Why?

* winter - cold freezing ?(bivvy not even good enough)
* not that much time for day session ? (need work and away from big city)
* second part of night (00:00 - 07:00)  - what's the behzvior carp ? any bite ? how likely ? what's temperature curve? , too dangerous and cold to sleep outside （传统观念：都说冬天鱼冷些动物，新城代谢低，那么下半夜了，温度的低的时候，会不会有草鲤鱼上钩了？）
* free water ? big lake nature water  ( not small pond or paid fishery or syndicate)
* test complext bait or chemicals ? (magots for winter, boillet for summer ?) - corn (nothhing more, just corn)

My angling background:  pole fishing but not that much expierence, no ice in winter

in china, pole fish is the prevailing fish style, like 90% in my hometown. people like the feeling of fish's pwoer transmiting via line /rod all the way to the hand.(tremors). It feels like a monster on your pole and feel of fighting with the fish is so wicked and satisfying when I got a grass carp  like 7-8 lb using 5.4 meters long pole and sweet corn.

reservoirs - The lake is very big like hundreds of acres. no one is feeding those fish, the fish is pretty much on its own, so the density is kinda low, not like high-stocked recreational fishery or syndicate. The local fishery resource in China, in general, is pretty bad. Some people uses all kinds of destructive fishing practices to catch the fish - e.g - electro、net of mesh with small hole、firecrackers. In nature water, the fishery resource is mostly damaged to a extent that fish that with weight over 1.5Kg ~ 2.5KG could be called - BIG size fish. There are some fish with weight over 20kg - 50kg (last time, one of my friend caught a carp fish with 12KG using pole rod in reservoir), but that's pretty rare. The type of carp here is almost all grass/common with super super rarely you could get a mirror, let alone any black/scaly carp type.

Here is some image in the lake. For big fish, people are angling with 8.1 meters - 10 meter long pole rod, prefeed/bait with fermented corns like every day in the same swim of the lake, then fish at the that day. For samll fish, 2.7m, 3.6m, 4.5m is pretty common. They try to fish further away from the bank at the side closing to the mountains - which is much deeper comparing to the opposite shallow side.

By talking with local anglers , they said the big fish is very hard to catch, usually they could caught one , bigger one after several days of waiting.  They need prefeed regulary with large mount of corn(fermented, homemade or bought ), extremely patient when fishing(long time of boring wait for the bite)、also extremely concentraction on the sign change of marker float . But once they got the bite, the feeling is so rewarding that previous efforts and boring wating is allll worthy it. Esp for pole fishing, picking up the rod、 jerking the line 、 pull it hard and setting the hook when you saw the marker float suddely dipped in then play/fight the fish, the feeling of tremors pass through the line,  adrenaline inside you,  that  is most exciting part of angling.

Reason people despise or look down the one using Rod（海竿或lure) are (here is link from angler tieba, sth like Angler subreddt(https://tieba.baidu.com/p/6348235004?red_tag=3265959682#128408796299l):

* SurfRod is passive, like setup, leave it then just wait for the alarm. one no need to always look at the marker float and there are lots of tricks on what kinda of marker float's movement relating to fish's behavior and what timing is the proper to pick up rod and jerk it ; second no setting the hook just wait util rod bell sound, the feel of hook set is missing .
* Pole fish when play fish is much harder and more intensive comparing to 海竿, becase they dont' have spooler/reels. They got higher chance of losing the fish , i.e.g not being able to land the fish, but that difficulit means you 're gonna put lots of work and concentraion for this phase (you have no way to backdown like Caesar crossing Rubicon river ).That dedication leads to greater satisfiction and apprecation for the angling.
* peple genreately setup lots of rod at one row like ( 3 ,4, 5,6 ..8) and multiple hooks in one rig, that sounds just for caughting the fish not for the fun of fishing process (爆炸钩创狗 - moral superiority); while pole fish you only have one or two rod(one sshorter rod for small fish, one longer rod for big fish) - each max only has two hooks
* 

Pole fish involve smore dedication / concentraction /complex technique/tricks and shorter feedback loop during the angling  comparing to the Rod fish, which leads to why most people think that pole fishing is much funnier and more interesting than rod fish.

Yeah, above those do make sense to some extent.  Different style, different kinda of fun. Since we focus on catching big fish, not small ones, it is important to layout the differences:

* waiting : both need to wait and wait for a long time.   海竿 you have bivvy or long chair to lay down comfortable. but pole fish you only got a chair, and need constantly stare at the float, it is kinda exgusting and not that comforatable.

* chances:  big fish tends to stay away from bank in daytime, so if you fish far from bank, it generally is deepr, and has a better chance to locate big fish.THe rod they're using are at least 7.2m long, could be 8.1, 9.2, 10.0 , 11 meters long. Even with lines, it could maxi get around 20 meters far(actually not that far, because the water usally is kinda deep and take out some lines), and it is pretty trick to cast out without reels. But with 海竿，you could easily cast out like 30meter at least, with good ones, like 70-80 meters is not that hard.

* Expense:  even the cheapest pole rod you could on taobao([奥西尼x7](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.25.23117b10Kpyfpn&id=641987583688&ns=1&abbucket=17#detail)) is gonna cost you 90-100 RMB like 15-16$.  But you could get a 2.7m rod and 5000 reels with around 45 RMB like 7-8$. With my experiment, that cheap combiniation(8 strands braided PE line 6.0/0.40mm/32KG with 100 meters long - price is 12RMB .i.e 2$) could  get me cast out like 30-40 meters in a breeze.(TODO: change to 4strands for more abrasion resistance, but no preoptimzation)

* landing fish: because you got reels and has drag, it is much easier to fight/play the fish once got bite. While if you're using Pole rod, you have pretty much fixed length line, which leaves very little room for mistake. I have seen lots of people fail to land the fish, because it cast out fully without buffer or extra room for flexibility(again conventional wisdom: the further, the better). if the fish got the bite, felt the pain, flail - e.g - ficerly shake its head, it might go striaght oppose to bank direction(the line fish and rod is like 180 degree aligned). Under this case, you might not even has a chance to pick-up your rod,  end up in  tug-of-war (in chinese拔河) - i.e. fish go that way, you go this way -  and most of time it is the angler got tumbled and have to leave out the rod from hands if line is strong enough or most likely line breaks. Either case, the fish descends into the depths and leave you stare in disbelief(哦豁oh ho - in chinese - i.e. - bosh/wicked).

  


So far, we have compared pole fish and sur fish, and each has its own pros and cons.



Pole fihs : marker float, analyza lake bed terriain and mersuare water depth.

Sur rod:  distance,easier to fight fish and land fish; comfortable



The fish strategy for my case would be a combination of pole fish and surf fish, but more inclined to suf fish. The distance is between pole fish and suf fish, neither too close nor too far.

#### ===Target

conditions: 

* reservoir : low stocked big nature water - still water
* target: 1.5KG - 15KG 
* time:  1-2 days consecutive
* unmanned/unattended:  passive and automatical
* baid/feed strategy: setup once, no middle of add more baiting/feeding 
* secretiveness:  detecting device should be small enough to be camouflaged and not easily be able to spot
* mobility : device and whole fish tackle should be easily to be assemble or dis-assemble
* setup: first cast out with rod and reel; then pull main line out of reel and rod and attatch to tent peg; carefully setup trigger between the main line and device.

Quick Summary: setup feeder/bait, cast out and link with tent pegs,  setup the bite alarm device, hook the trigger between mainline and device.  Leave it for 1-2 days. When got bite from fish,  the strength will trigger alarm, hence give a call to my phone so that I could just go there and pickup and land the fish. But we also need some hearbeat to know that device is running properly. Every one minutes,  it send a http request to my backend which log its timstamp and whether it got triggered or not.  With this data,  later we could analyze what time it got bite and what temperature from online historical weather data.



### Angling strategy

It is always good to draw some inspiration from existing carp fishing strategys like pole fishing and day session of carp fishing. 

*A beard well lathered is half shaved.*

**Swim/Location**: The first thing you need is to analyze the terrian of where you fish - read water. Either take a walk aroud the water area, or searching its google map statelite image, or asking from local angler, just try figure out the general terrin of water you're gonna fish. No rush to drop you rods. For picking the right swim, it is always good to have direct eye sight of fish rollover or buble of stiring mud. And most of time, you want to stay away from those with high angling pressures from the bank. In winter, generaly you want your fish spot is closing to snags or something structure(weed beds、fallen trees 、overhanging vegetation or rocks) that provide safer places to hide for a school of fish instead of open water.

(here is the lake genenral shape ) 标识点位 钓点

The left side is the deep water area with mountains sliding into water very sharply, that right side is kinda shallow  full of debris left from submerged rice field. Most poeple will pick the left side with deeper open-water and less snags but rocky at the margin, and I barely see anyone fishing on the rice field side.  But I decided to go from the rice fields, the reasons are:  1. Even though it has snags like debris of rotten rice plants,  it doesn't do that much damage comparing to rocky strucuture , considering it is unmanned and unattended. When fish got the bite, felt the pain, it is gonna drag the line to whereever it felt safe - which mostly is full of snags or deep water so to say. A rocky structure would be much easier to cut the line due to its sharpness than some softy rotten debris could.  2. Helicopter or chod rig could help lift up the hook from lake bed and present nicely without being buried in the debris  -  interestinly I have never seen anyone of pole fish use chod rig or sort of before.

**Depth**: Another key is to select appropriate water depth for fishing spot. Often we've heard people saying: "The deeper the better", for deep water could hide big size fish. Also some says " You should pick margins - where shallow water meets deeper water - a sharp drop-off or deep channel". Some says "in winter/autumn, go for deep, in spring&summer, go for shallow". This is just very confusing. After talked with some local angler with different level's angling experience, pretty much everyone gives  different opinons - there is just no consensus.  Here is a quick comparison from what they say:

| shallow water              | deep water         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| more food                  | less food          |
| not that safer, more noisy | Safer, quieter     |
| high oxygen content        | low oxygen content |
| warm                       | cold               |

Rule of thumb: water temperature and oxgen content is two key factors dictating fish feed activity . While the last one about water temperature, there are kinda opposite for summer and winter. In summer, surface of water is warm, the bottom is cold; but in winter, vice versa.*On the one* hand,  It looks like every saying has its right points, but on the other hand, it seems it somehow contradicts with others. So the middle water column (the one shallow meets deeper) is the correct one to go ?  This just intrigued me - I spent some time reseaching and watched lots of carp fish videos of both China and outside China.

(Fishery genemry IFishman)

Talk is cheap. Show me the code. 

Here is some graphcs that germany fishery lab did on a nature water pond/lake. They marked different types of fish with different electronic instrument(show in different colors), track their signals of activity across the whole year and got some interesting data. For example, in winter, you might think the fish will hide in the deepest part of lake, but it turns out they all huddle together on the shallow border(reminiscence of stock operator - oops, no - winter time of elementary school - we all huddle togher at the corner of classroom in a american football way). Another interesting observation,  we might think as the temperature and oxygen levels drops to the lowest point during the midnight, to that extent, that  fish will simply stop all kindas activity -  statue of sluggish. However the graphic shows they actually are still moving around during what we perceived as "the worst time of day".  That just blows my mind.

That just shows how we project what we think on behalf of the fish. What you think fish should do != what fish does on its own. You can't know what fish is thinking(suppose it has a thinking in whatever you might named it  - dao/god/natura naturans), instead you could only guess from their behaviors.  To anaylze behaviors and actions,  we could borrow from Francias Bacon's scientifc method.  Namely put our prejudices 、preconception and old sayings/claims under inspection, careful observation on the fact,   tabulation and classification on factors that possibly lead to the fact，setup experiments to verify etc - investigative method to form a empirical study which not based on ideas and theories. don't get me wrong，I'm not saying that you should overwhelm yourself with everything by yourself (the earth is flat)- some you could stand on the shoulder of gaint.  A good way is to identify what's [hard science and soft science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science).  Angling is pretty much like sociology and economics, it is very hard to do a controlled experiment - there are simply too many factors involved and isolation becames pretty much impossilbe to do. You could angle with same bait/same fish tackle, in same swim , in same season and pretty much same sunny day, same temperature/wind from weather report, but very likely you have different results - to say the least - maybe a full fishing keepnet or just blank - never you got same result.

From my experience and ponder-over, sometimes , as angler, maybe we need shift our perspective from chasing after certaintiy(conventional wisdom) to getting along with probability and statistics - i.e - uncertaninty. I will elaborate more on this in following secions.

However shifted to thinking in terms of probabiliy and statistics, doesn't mean  you dont' wahter you want to or just being clueless like headless chicken or dont need any logic and reasoning. Well, quite to the contrary, you need do your homework(If there is one silverbullet) like what Joel Greenblat said in [<<The Little Book That Beats the Market>>](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Still-Beats-Market/dp/0470624159) -  it requires careful design the experiment based on as much as possibly pre-collected data at your hand, welly and thourlghy analyzed , then took a reasonable guess, apply it via some trial and error. (ps: well, you just angle for first couple of times,  you might got the beginner's luck - you could laught at me - but hey bloke - your sample size is too small...)

In my case, the depth of the mountain side is like 5-6 meters deep from about 4-5 meters close to bank. It could even deeper farther way. On the other side , the shallow side, is like 2-3 meters deep from 4-5 meters - since I only do pole fish  and never use surf rod bebfore. I have no idea bout about what's depth of 20-30 - 50 meters away. Given what I know, it looks 3-8 meters depth could be a good ballkpark for winter from shallow side to try out first.



**Distance**

Along the previsouly mentioned old saying "The deeper the better", there is another corresponding old saying "The further the better" for casting. Conventional wisdom or those old sayings are good start point at first,  but never it shall be treated as something like doctrine. Those sayings are generally short , high condensed, and concise abstractions , well, at the sacrifice of leaving out full context and details of specific cases. They are best served as guidance(outward), and you need to dig it out by yourself(inward) - Turning outward guidances into intward experience. As Bruce Lee says in <<Enter the dragon>>：

>  "Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!"

If you're doing pole fishing, you know from probiliity perspective, the longer the rod and line, the higher chance you could catch big size fish. Why? because often the closer to bank, typically the shallower the water would be,  espec in day time, more noisy it would be - which is not a safe place for big fish(Carp is really smarter and more spooky than what you think they might be) to hide. Even so, veteran anglers still would cast out a couple of rods to test depth around the target fish spot -left,right, front or back -  to get a better idea about the lakebed terrain. This is very nature for pole fishing since it has marker floating and it is quite easy to test out the water depth from disntance of 2 meter - 10 meters. But for surf rod fishing it is little bit tricky, for it doesn't have a marker floating buit-in.  

It is not uncommon for some surf rod anglers just to rush to start fishing - cast out extremely long distance without much thought as soon as they arrived at the lake, and spend lots of time waiting on the bank, yet they didn't wanna just spend a few casts to test out the water depth and lake bed terrain of fish spot beforehand. They just go there, mount the hookbait and cast out whereever they want, then just wait like "I'm done with work on my side, it is the fish - your turn to bite".  Yes, they still coud get a bite from fish and caught it , no doubt.  But hmmm, lets take another proablbity game -  basetketball as exmaple , the goal of shooting  is to get basketball throught he hoop and score. Well think about it is the last shot - a possible buzzbeater,  there are two game plans from coache - one is Micachel Jordan or Kobe Byrant is taking the shot , if they got the cold hands(look : self-proclaimed GOAT [🐑](https://emojipedia.org/ewe/)Lebron James only got 8 points in the nba finals...) and it is highly possible for them to miss it; another is a nobody like me taking the shot, if I got the hot hand(every dog has its day), I might hit it.  But nonobyd would think I'm better than Micachel or Kobe, because they could do it consistently and with solid fundamentals of pyshican and mental - some of them is from hard-work training and desire to strieve for greatness and push theirself ot the limit . 

So just because it is a paobolity game full of randoms, it is aslo eactly why we need build our firmly well-sturcture reasonging from our experincen and observation during prepration(Cephas - lay the groundwork), setup open/continuous feedback loop during process(mieache jordan develop from early days altehic dunker -air jordan -  into an ellite fade-away jumper in his late years)，lower the expectation for the outcome - Let the chips fall where they may. And be aware of that temptation and emotion of yourself, try to know yourself better.

Then what's some fundentmtls here? cast out accuraccly . just pracice, you dont' need exact same spot,  some offset is perfectine fine - Remember it is not rock sicence.  For me, It didn't took me long to  be able to cast accurenty like 30 meter disnace with 1-3 meters radius in that vicinity.  I found it is extemly useful to record the moves of your casting in video. You could see your posture,movmenet and adjust accordingly - [The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740) - what you think of yourself is probably not what you really are.

Casting out a couple of times  also help you get a great detail on the lakebed of fish spot  - is it gravel、rocky or weedy or silty ? Flat or sharp dropoff ?  How you gonna choose right rig strategy for it. Fish might get sacred and flee away by the sound of lead hitting the water surface, but some underwater video experiment shows those fish will slowly get back to search for the food. It is not a big deal in my case, as I have lots of time and patience for it while sitting cozily at the home wiith heating on and drinking my [Longjing/Dragon Well tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longjing_tea) - How wicked is that ! :)

I have chosen the distance like 20-30 meters far away from the bank. Since my focus is on fish's nocturnal behaviors, and night is quieter than day time, also based on what I know from above depth section, hence my assumption is that big fish will be morely likely to go to shallow water that close to bank where it could have more food to feed.


## BAIT/Feeder

Basically how could we attract the fish into the swim? Well, the fish use mostly following senses to detect and indentify whehter something is good to eat or not : smell、taste、sight. Fish have a pretty good olfactory system to sense any dissolved substance in the water ,and they could recognize the smell of  amino acids and others having nutritional value. Chemoreception - They could taste, esp for carp, they sucks in a big mouth of silt and other detritus -  when they smell or feel via taste buds from their barbules, pectoral and pelvic fins of the eatable like bloodworm/corn etc - palatal taste organ in the mouth trap the food against the bottom of the mouth and expell non-food through gills(almost 90% got ejected). Also they have sensitive eyes, could see in lower light levels under the water and detetct changes in light and movement above the water - so camouflage like Rambo, anglers! However, their habit of feeding in the sediments on the bottom searching for small buried food items has required them to rely on highly developed senses of smell and taste.


Generally the feeding habit of carp is most fixed and stable like routine - eat what is plentiful - but sometime they will break it or at least try to discover new food sources. It is a dynamic process. Mostly stable-better chance, sometimes dynamic - slim chance. Consider that the reservoir which has lots of rice field/reed/mulberry tree around it, then most likely the rice/reed/mulbeery will get you better chance to get a bite consistently comparing to other food like corn that fish never see it before. On the other hand, if you prefeeding the same spot with lots of corn regularly over a long period of time, the feeding behavior of fish might change accordingly. The carp is not one-track minded, they're open to adapt their feeding habit if it works.

With those being said, it is always good to spend sometime beforehand looking at the surrounding of fishing location、talking to local angler to get a good idea about what kinda feeding/baiting feed are best for. Some anglers boast about the effectiveness of flavoured baits esp in those commercial videos - it is like the silver bullet for y'all. Touting how good the flavors or scents are with a vareity of chemicals as if it comes from some alchemist 、how pink color of boilies  performs better than yellow - `buy me you stupid angler,then you will be as wicked as me`. There are two common thought patterns:

* 1. If I feel good about it, then the fish must be feel the same like I feel, then the fish must feel good about too, hence go bite it.

* 2. It works for me for a couple of times, then it must work for you too.

The first one - induction - seems very strightforward , but with a short ponder,  shows it is flawed. The middle premise just couldn't stand. I saw lots of angler smell the bait, but come on, you need also taste the bait too, but no one did that :)  If the bait smells good, then they will think it could attract more fish than those which smells bad. Even though the way that those modlecurles trasmitting throught air is different from those tramsinting thought water, let alone different receptors betwen human being and fish, adding scents and flavors does attract the fish. but the question here is how to measure its effectiveness.`sola dosis facit venenum` - how much is approrate to be defined as a natural flvor and scent level for the fish. It has some range, isn't ?
Is it always "the more the better"? to how much it could just backfire?(Some Wu Wei wisdom from Livemore : Money is made by sitting, not trading)

Be be fair, those question are kinda difficult to find answers(or proably couldn't) and demand those "Charismatic leadership" 、 so-called carp fishing masters in the promoting videos from commerical fish tackle brands to put a disclaimer at the beginning - saying *"I'm not 100% sure about whether this fancy bait will work  - so you could buy this expensive one but it didn't work at all or even getting worse - and I just have no idea"*  - is kinda picky. But given human kinda are just natureally likes imitating as beginners, and nothging is more straightforwarnd、 intuitve and easier to reach  widely like videos , they're likly to copy what those teachter does , i.e. buy whatever tackles those masters are using and master's tackles and equiqments are damn pricy! They want to get their `hello world` running as soon as possible to get thrills, hey nobody is gonna read pages of document to get exact details of it - and I have no problem with that people are making money out of it.(Hey, I'not a contemporary cynicism and do like [franknesss from Adam Penning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLiArMvlfpg&ab_channel=CARPologyTVCarpFishing) among other carp fishing masters).

Either you dont' put up your effort and do your homework (expierment - retrospection/adjustment -expierment) and you pay with high price, or you pay with cheaper price, then put up your effort and do your homework. the second one in longer term is way more feasible/possible to have all planets aligned and hit the jackpot. Because those commerical baiting are just general abstractons by leaving out specfical details and contexts, you have to try different ones to try to match the context in your individual case: Up -> Bottom vs Bottom -> Up.

Still you can buy those branded ones, no problem , but just dont trap yourself into the mindset that you need to buy the most fancy and most expensive ones to get most bites. Fishing has a context, each is different. And context has so many factors, that baiting is just one of them and no one factor is over others by a crazy margin - if yes, then it only means it is just a snapshot. 

And that comes with the second thought pattern. They shows you the empirical success without talking about context or primary attributing factors - how carp fish uses their eyesight. Like in some video they says pink colored boilies is bettern than yellow ones and it is helping them catch more fishes - go get the pinks. But they leave out the stats like what time and what kinda of water condition in terms of visibiliy like full of sediments or clear one - those relates to the eyesight. Just because i have this empircal success, you 're gonna have the same success if you copy my fishing strategy - hmmmm?

To conclude, rice - from obeervation of rcie field ,  and feed corn (or maize) -  from local anglers,  is picked as candidates for the carp bait. Cleary I don't want wait for hours to get small fish bite , so the rice or pellets or small particles will be excluded. Since I'm gonna leave it under the water for 1-2 days, those bait shouldn't be easily dissovled or lose its liveness like live bait. So big solid particle like feed corn is a perfect fit and most important part is it is juuuust so cheap and so simple to prepare. Buy some feed corn, soak it and boil it, if you'd like - not necessary- could try experiment by adding some molasses or alcohols like Baileys or Tsingtao beer or hemp oil later.(Who knows! I have some Turmeric&Curry&Coriander&Garam masala powder left from last time trying cook indian food, and I might add those to test out)


After picked the bait for feeding, next thing is about the feeding strategy. Obiviously most reasonable one is to take little bit time to just chumming some baits to same spot every day(like one week or one month) before you really get your rods out and start fishing. But is is impossible for me as I only got 4-7 days holiday break and I really dont' want spend too much time on the bank to fish - I only got one hour break each day to go outdoors for fishing(family first) - that's exactly why I come up with an idea about auto carp fishing. To make it up, I decide to choose one fishing spot and bait there instead of moving around the lake on the bank. Here is my two cents on how to effectively attract fish in big nature water by feeding/baiting:

图片（打窝中心）

Basically we have the fish spot in the center, and feeding, i.e - corn- is evenly scattered around it forming a cricle with 3-5 meter radius. Loose chumming could possibly attract further fishes in a longer distance than precise baiting, as it could cover bigger and wider water area by its falvors and scents. Then we use pva bags or pva mesh to precisely bait right in the center this circle. Well this seems pretty ideal, the tricky part is how to get chumming like what hands can do but in a longer distance ? Slingshot、Spod、 pva bags/mesh、 gaint throwing sticks/baiting spoon even fishing bait boat couldn't do that easily.

In above picture and videos, that is a home-made spod with bottle and a lead. You could see that the corns inside the bottle will be detached from the lead/sinker benehter it as it is falling and is about to hit the water. Those dry corns has a lighter weigh comparing to the lead and will split out and be scattered into the water - inside a circle of 3-5 meters. The downside is the baiting inside it need to be light/dry and also it won't cast out very far away given its bad aerodynamic shape. But it fits my case - actually that's exactly my intention to not fish from a very long distance. Everything has its pros and cons, just like coding or system or archecture design, you need analyze the situation first to get a big picture,then weighs between different apporaches, prioritize and comes to a trade-off.

Here are some common explation on fish acivity:  water temperature and oxygen content.  High barometric pressure forces more oxygen into water



Angling is about emprical mostly of you, share/learn with others ,but in the end, it is you to put it into action under your unique situation/condition and get the feedback and figuring our your strategy and framework. It is not rock science, it deson't mea you ndont need do your homework. you simply need to know what you're doing.

you need to ensure thereis not much sngas around there; second you need ensure it won't cause significate pain for the fish, liek you could just drop the sinker so it won't add too much burden/pain to the fish (little resisitance(drop off sinker))

实际钓大鱼没什么区别, 钓大鱼只有守， 需要极大的耐心，有时候一天没有一口， 钓小鱼就有变化，饵料钓组频率的变化，钓大鱼不能有频率，不然吓走鱼。

casting precisly:

* limit by psychical  or line clip 

  

differences to carp fishing:

* 水库图片山或者稻田，no way to use barrow or bivvy (too heavy)



target: 1.5KG-15 KG fish max, 



AUTOMATICALY VS normal CPAR DIALY SESION

TIME：long(1-2days) vs short

FEEDER: slow(last longer) - baiting method is different(chumming and laser focus/precise) vs fast

bait: corn vs boilet/peolliot/maggots

MODEL : passsive(no angler nearby) vs active()

FISHIN DISTANCE: short vs long (why counterintuitive)

rod: no rod vs rod 

bite alarm: automatical trigger vs normal bite alarm line trigger

agnling pressure: low always, oppose to where mostly people fishing swim



open water(less snags) + shallow water(not always deepest) + close to bank 

day time : hiding the deep water or near snags like structure of rocks/reefs (safety)  - noisy 

night time: go to the shadllow water (close to bank) to get food - quiet



1. why open water

no man is constant checking it , could happen in the midnight or sometime you're sleeping, and it could some time for you to go the swim/bank. 

Fish could drag the lines/hooks anywhere that fish feel safe. And most likely coudl be one with snags, like rocks/reefs/.

2.  shallow water(not always deepest)s

deepeest is the best ?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAFhejwoSM&ab_channel=IFishMan

 It is important to see that the big carp are not set in the deepest part of the lake.

Now comes December - the carp start again shortly before St. Nicholas. What on earth are the carp doing on the shallow border, and why aren't they at the deepest point in the western basin?



Winter the water is cold, yeah, it got deeper mostly it si warmer. but there is another case like pile of reefs, their termp is higher that open water. shallow water generally has more food compaing to deep water. so it need has some depth but not that much deeper needed. based on the lake you fish, rule of thumb would 3-8 meters.

3. close to the bank 

​	Here comes antoher conventional thought. YOu awalys need to fish furthest possile, as if the big fish is hiding in the center of the lake. Yes, somehow make senese, but not that much.  YOU need ask question first: where possile the fish is in this particular lake or pond ?

Assess the terrain and lake's condition , like where it gots most trees , where it go the reefs or farms or whatever. what ttime and termparua/season you're fishing, if is summer, probably it won' matter much as fish is very active; in winter, you mostly want find snags or reefs (that possiblly more inclined to be close to the bank). SO find the spot, then cast it.



The day session you probably need const looking for signs of carp activity like rollover or direct eyesight, or bubble ereged from water, sometime climb up and dowsn to get some peeks where they are.

But in my case, that's not every helpful as the water is soooo big. I choose to close to bank for some reasons, during the night, the  surrounding could be quiet, fish are more likely staying the area that close to the bank for food.



4 multi hooks(stinger-hook?) rig or single hook rig

Here, in china, mostly angler using 串钩 or 爆炸钩 - i.e multi rigs along the lines-  to increase the chances to catch the fish. But that comes with problem: it is very easy for their hooks to get trapped with rocks or reefs/snags when they casting out or they drag the fish after got a bite. 

https://fishingmagic.com/forums/threads/more-than-one-hook.239744/

I guess differences we fishing mostly for pot & recreactonal, mostly people lives not close to sea. but like cpar fishing, mostly poplar in uk, they have more sea fishes with less bones like freshwater fishes.

The biggest things I can see against using two hooks is the flailing hook that can get snagged when playing the fish and there is also the thing in if you get a break off...a fish would stand more of a chance in getting caught up we go to the extent of lead clips weak links etc....why would anyone want to add this as a factor???



If you don't like the idea of two hook rigs then don't use them, but don't try to claim some sort of moral superiority for your choice.



一般淡水鱼垂钓 coarse fishing

bailey



for secreteiveness:

* no rod
* device for detecting(bite alarm) https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=carp+fishing+alarm&oq=carp+fishing+alarm&aqs=chrome..69i57.5996j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8



setup rod/bait/feeder, setup the bite alarm device, hook those two, wait for 1-2 days, when got fish,  bite alarm device could give a call to my phone so that I could just go there and pickup and land the fish. well, every one minutes, send acc,x,y,z and tmeratorat to my backend , so that I could debug and check what's the temparuate looks liek and what time the fish got bite, to build a personal and model for fish's behavior. (ELK)

start with small/easy, not overthinking beforehead (preoptimozation ), fail fast and get feedback loop quick







Fishing is the probablity game, very much like investing in stock market.

Preparation(with efforts) + Randomneess = 


保证鱼不容脱钩发力

* 泄力 - 比如弹簧 或者橡皮筋 rubber band or fabric latex
* 铅坠 - 活动 - 这样鱼不会那么会摆动
* 缓冲 - 加多10米的线在岸上
* open water, less snags or structure (rock formations/too much weedy)

As we shall see, the difference is one of emphasis and execution rather than of principle. Aristotle favors the discussion of general principles that can be arrived at on the basis of an intuitive grasp of natures, while Bacon stresses the importance of slow and careful induction from specific cases.
