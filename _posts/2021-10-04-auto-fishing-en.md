Auto carp fishing


Why?

* winter - cold freezing ?(bivvy not even good enough)
* not that much time for day session ? (need work and away from big city)
* second half of the night (00:00 - 07:00)  - what's the behzvior carp ? any bite ? how likely ? what's temperature curve? , too dangerous and cold to sleep outside （传统观念：都说冬天鱼冷些动物，新城代谢低，那么下半夜了，温度的低的时候，会不会有草鲤鱼上钩了？）It is said that larger fishes are more active at night and dawn.
* free water ? big lake nature water  ( not small pond or paid fishery or syndicate)
* simple bait will work ? no need for test complext bait or chemicals ? (magots for winter, boillet for summer ?) - corn (nothhing more, just corn)


I only have some pole fishing experiences, but not that much. In China, pole fishing is the prevailing fish style. People like the feeling of adrenaline rush when there is a fish on your pole. I still remember how wicked and satisfying the feeling is when I got a grass carp like 7-8 lb using 5.4 meters long pole and sweet corn.

<cite>Left side is the grass carp(3-5lb/7-8lb), top right is the crucian carp (2lb, weight over 1lb is considered as big one for curcian carp), bottom right is the pond)</cite>

But when I switched from pond to nature water like big lake - reservoir, I had so many blanks. I start to realize how difficult it is to catch a big size fish there. And the pattern in pond fishing is totally different from the wild water fishing. No one is feeding those fishes and density is very low. So most people go to high-stocked recreational fishery or syndicate for fun instead of nature water. The low density is because fishery resource here is kinda getting destroyed somehow. There used to have all kinds of destructive fishing practices to catch the fish - e.g - electro、net of mesh with small hole、firecrackers - which is not sustainable. But it is getting better as life is improving and people and goverment start to realize they need protect the nature resources(An unprecedented 10-year fishing moratorium was issued in January 2020, covering 332 conservation areas in the Yangtze River basin.) It is a process.

And I could say that fish that with weight over 1.5Kg ~ 2.5KG could be called - BIG size fish here. There are some fish with weight over 20kg - 50kg (last time, one of my friend caught a grass carp over 12KG~24LB using pole in this reservoir), but that's pretty rare. The type of carp here is almost all grass/common with super super rarely you could get a mirror, let alone any black/scaly carp type.

After I observed from and talked with those local anglers here, they are angling with 8.1 meters - 10 meter long telescopic pole, prefeed/prebait with feed corns like every day in the same swim, then start fishing all the day. Going blank is not uncommon, and they might catch big one after waiting for weeks. Sometimes they are also trying surf rod to casting out with longer distance with pack bait and rebait every two hours but still no luck. There was a time when I tried fishing with 5.4 meters pole with corn on the bank of the reservior, I saw two anglers nearby me using 10 - 12 meters pole just keep baiting with spoon and rebait their hook and the whole afternoon, no a single bite and they ended up with just playing their phones :) 

An idea just popped into my head. How about making this waiting process kinda non-attended? Then in raniny days or on snowing/windy days, or cold times like second half of the night and dawn, the fishing is just happening there and you dont need to stay on the bank (even though surfrod fishing could be more comfortable and less concentration required comparing to pole fishing). So your time could be freed up to do other things and when fish got a bite, it triggers something and notify you via something like Wechat/Telegram or just a call - like interrupts in MCU.


## Norway Fishing Industry/Vibe

I still remember when I was a kid, I use self-made bamboo pole and earthworm that digged out of my backyard to catch fish which is pretty effective and simple. Nowdays it is jaw-dropping to know that fishing gears and equiments are getting so complicted and segemnted,coming with so many variations. Take a look at the pole fish gears in China and correspondings in West:

![](/assets/carp_fishing_en1/pole_fishing.jpg)
<cite> click to see bigger picture</cite>

For pole fishing: A 7.2 meter telescopic pole is at least 300 RMB for moderate quality, 1000RMB0-2000RMB for good ones.They are tons of components and accessories: [fishing platform](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002382124941.html)、[multifunctional fishing box](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003307267441.html)、[fishing bucket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000096264484.html)、[fishing chair](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003186497852.html)、[fish umbrella/brolly](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002868486443.html)、fishing bag etc. The fishing platform is especially heavy if you 're buying cheap one that made by metal.

![](/assets/carp_fishing_en1/pole_fishing_gears.jpg)

Those gears add up lots of weight and they are not easy to carry around. Look the mountains and rice field around that revoriro, I'm pretty sure by the time I got to the bank, I'm already exhausted. I thought the chinese way is somehow maximalistic. Guess what? Western carp fish is just a little bit more maximalistic :)

<cite>Fox Carp Fishing Youtube: [CARP FISHING IN WINTER (Catch more on cold days)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUdfbnZ_Qu4&ab_channel=FoxInternationalCarpFishing)
</cite>

A wheelbarrow - I thought angling is about minimlistic and keep it simple, until some Fox/Korda/Nash/Gardner/Mainline angler of carp fish comes with a wheelbarrow and point to all kindas gears(mat、bivvy、camo cool bags、 bait belts, coffee maker、tea press、kettle、stove、dinner set and cookare sets etc) inside it smirking and saying:  "oh my gawd, dear comrade，my young bloke, how dare you? I'm the true minimalist - just one item".

Surely, good equiqments tackles and gears could bring better angling epxerince, some edges and more comfotaable when angling - unless you know what're doing. Like a double-edged sword, it comes with pros and cons. Those equipments really make it so cumbersome to move around, even demoralizing, just take a look the moutains and rice field in my case - how steep the slope is in moutain side and how close those rice fields are laid out next to each other like a grid.  

![](/assets/carp_fishing_en1/tough_road.jpg)

<cite>ps: Even though I'm pretty back to primitivism with just single fishing bag and a washbasin for fish and as possible trash bin, I still feel little bit exhausted when climbing up and downs. Don't tell me that somebody fancy carrying a barrow of heavy gears around in here.
</cite>

Those commerical tackle compainies mainly targets recreational fishery like pond or farm-raised syndicate, not for wild fishing. Isn't recreational fishing supposed to be simple , lightweight and relaxing instead of a ...a barrow? Early Churchch Fathers and later Meister Eckhart, must feel kinda of offended by the Roman Curia's long and boring church services , ceremonies and rites (In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritu Sancti. Amen - people just couldn't bear with it, so much so that they coined a word in Spanish for it: santiamén).

Unless you're professional angler or anglers that have a lot of time, just fishing for the fun and blending in with nature to be like a Dionysian of Nietzsche during precious break, then fishing in wild water is the way to go and really no need for top-notch gears/baits to get started.

Here is my humble opion on why?

## Fishing Explained 

>  “In our reasonings, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance—from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence. A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence.” - David Hume


Fishing is not rocket science(see [hard science and soft science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science)). It is pretty much like sociology and economics - dealing with probability and statistics. it is very hard to do a controlled experiment because there are simply too many factors involved and isolation becames pretty much impossilbe to do so. That's a pretty important shift in perspective, just like investment and sports, from 100% certainty to uncertainty and odds of randomness.

![](/assets/carp_fishing_en1/iceberg.jpg)

<cite>According to Freud (1915), the unconscious mind is the primary source of human behavior. Like an iceberg, the most important part of the mind is the part you cannot see - [Freud and the Unconscious Mind](https://www.simplypsychology.org/unconscious-mind.html)</cite>

Now think about the catch rate and its factors:

	Catch Rate = water temperature + barometric pressure +sunny/cloudy + wind(Windward/leeward) + season/timing + water bodies(pond/rivers/lakes vs still/flowing/creek/current) + waterbed(gravel/weedy) + terrain(depth/basin/drop off) + food source + bait flavors/scents + speice of fish + ... 

There is just a whole lots of levels of randomness inside it.

Factors like iceberg above the water are the ones we could observe from our expericences. Some factors are more general and universal, some are quite idfferent to differente speices of fish. Those are the ones at least we could study and learn to figure something plausible out like patterns to improve our chances. To some extent, fishing is a bit rocket science and you can do your homework with reasoning. You can get wisdom and theories from reading books、watching videos、taking with expirenced anglers - very effective way to build up your understanding about the fishing. A good example would be fish anatomy and behaviors patterns - know the fish you're angling at - is it bottom fishing or surface fishing? what water column it prefers? how it feeds? how it find foods? what temperature it likes? etc. Even for carp, there are so many different kinds of carp and its behavior might vary a lot, e.g, it would be extremely low chance to use corn what grass carp likes a lot to get any bighead carp a bite. There are some nice carp underwater fishing compilations on Youtube like [<Underfishing Best carp underwater fishing compilation 2020 (High quality)>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGKLmPr6kSg&ab_channel=Underfishing) showing how carp got caught in front of camera.

The iceber under the water is a big X - sometimes we called it "luck" - it shows the limits of our knowledge.Its randomness is beyond our undstanding. It reminds us the our logic/reasoning that built on top of it is inherently not that stable as we might think and open to changes from undernethat it. Hence we could answer some question like "what one single factor could stand out significatnlty over thoses in this equation?"  The answer is no.  Unless you fish in a controlled fine-tunned condition like a vaccum pond, you might have one factor over others. But that justa pplied to taht specific case,and it would be practically impossible to actually determine with wild fishing.

No silver bullet for software enginering, no magic chart pattern of technical analysis for investment, no magic bait, no super bait. Additionaly it reveals that those best practices or golden tips or rules of thumbs from others are just their summary of their past expiernce which are not tested by your personal experience. Their context might be(for sure) different from yours subjectively and objectively. You can not have two same icebergs, can you?

To turn other people's experience and theory(outside) to yours(innerizing), you need to do it by yourself, in your own personal expericen. How? through trial and error and learn from it, remember no books or videos and nothing could substitute for your personal experience. Dont'get me wrong, those guidances serve greately as a starting point or sth to fallback on when you just have no clue, but never it should be taken as doctine or sth forever true. Fishing is dynamic process and just about being personal. If you want consistency in longer time over randomness, then you cant count on the bginner's luck or finding some magic shortcut. You should do your homework - for example like what Joel Greenblat said in [<<The Little Book That Beats the Market>>](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Still-Beats-Market/dp/0470624159) -  and put in effects and times will build it up. Once we know the probability - nature of randomness, get yourself right in one go by buying expenive stuff from or imtating those - in Max Weber's term, [Charismatic authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_authority) alike - masters displayed in the videos of commerical tackle companies simply not gonna work. You want do trial and error many times in a budge and affordable way to figure out your fishing style and strategy that fits your specfic case.

It sounds like software development/lean startup/investment and other things, the idea is same: keep agile, fail fast, embracing changes. 

> :
> 
> Do your homework(Foundamentals) + Luck
> 
> Dedicated + Open minded

The dyanmic and probabilistic nature of fishing process means you need prepare yourself up with a good mindset. Sometimes, you not doing your homework but still great luck, turning out to be a good catch. At some other times, you did your homework hardly but no luck turning out to be fruitless, a blank. That blank is very common for fising big size fish in nature wild water, like [gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) for studying human behavior in sociology, just think about how many extremely tall guys you have met. To illustrate that, I put a  [Galton Board]() to get an idea of the normal distribution emerge from a random drop of ball-bearings.

Big size fishes are more spooky and pretty smart in nature water. Just like anglers need put in work and wait for all planets to align to get a bite, those fishes also need have all the X factors aligned perfectly to growing to that size.

The unpredictability is sth you can't control, but the process is sth you can contrl  kinda of and be enjoyed. Angling always has offered something to learn about, through it , you learn not just that - fishing outside -  but also yourself, and build up some awareness of your person identiy (self) and appreicate and reconnect with the beauty and serenity of the nature. To me, I personally like fishing in nature water, and that is really relaxing.

So I'd suggest those commerical tackle companies could put one-liner as a disclaimer to show their frankness/deep respect/sincere care for fishing in their promotion videos on the youtube: `"It depends!"`


## Fishing Scenario

some requirements and conditions of this fishing case: 

* reservoir : low stocked big nature water - wild water
* target: big size fish with 1.5KG - 15KG 
* time:  1-2 days consecutive
* unmanned/unattended:  automatical
* baiting/feeding strategy: pre-baiting/feeding once and no halfway rebate
* secretiveness:  detecting device should be small enough to be camouflaged and not easily be able to spot from the bank
* mobility : device and whole fish tackle should be easily to be assemble or dis-assemble

Quick Summary: prebait and hook the bait, cast out, take down the fishing line from reel, knot with tent pegs on the bank. Then setup the bite detecting device, link the trigger between fishing line and device. Leave it for 1-2 days. When got bite from fish,  the strength of fish fleeing way on the fishing line, will trigger alarm, hence give a call to my phone so that I could just go there and pickup and land the fish. 

But we also need some hearbeat to know that device is running properly. Every one minutes,  it send a http request to my backend server which log its timstamp and whether it got triggered or not.  With this data,  later we could know what time it got bite and what temperature it is.

Keywwords: wild water、big-size carp、automatical, winter、night and dawn(fish behavior).

A quick recap: As previsouly said, I have seen lots of local anglers(some of my friends) spending lots of time on the bank just waiting for bite using pole. And in carp fishing of UK/US this got little bit better with bivvy/coffee maker/cookware etc esp in the ranning and snowing days but just too cumbersome&expensive to carry around. Still stay up whole night in the wild doesn't seem to be a relaxing and comfortable experience. Fishing in the second half of night is pretty rare to see and possible a quite new territory to explore just out of my curiosity. That's exactly why I got this idea: non-attened carp fishing. 

Before I jump right to the automatical part - trigger device and how it works, like an old sayings "A beard well lathered is half shaved", I need analyze what kinda fishing strategy would fit in overall big picture ().

## Fishing Strategy

I learned many tips and techniques from enourpean carp fishing through videos and books. However carp fishing in China, esp wild carp in wild water - in my case a big reservior - its behaviors are quite idfferent from enourpean style as Enourpean are primarily fishing in stocked ponds either commercial fishery or sydnicate that farm-raised carp has no predators. The fishing resource in China is worse than the US. I have watched some US carp fishing vidoes(some chinese people cane poling in Califormnia and catch lots of carp fish with good size) , which its wild water is more simmilar to my case but the density there is still much higher than here. I dare challenge those carp fishings masters come to China and test themselves on the real battlefield :)

As said previsouly, there is no secret bait, no magic gear that will surely give you a bite. Even if you have best rod and reel、most expensive bait、fanciest and most elegant barrow in the world, all that stuff doesn't make a lick of differnce if you're not putting your bait in front of the fish.

One big factor of consistent catch is just find where fish are, esp in the winter. Location is crucial!

### Swim/Location

The first thing you need is to analyze the terrain of where you fish - read water. Either take a walk aroud the water area, or searching its google map statelite image, or asking from local angler, just try figure out the general terrain of water you're gonna angle at. No rush to drop you rods. For picking the right swim/spot, it is always good to have direct eyesight of fish rollover or bubbles from stiring mud. 

![](/assets/carp_fishing_en1/fish_road.jpg)

<cite>The rectangle area is a fishing road which Darrell Peck found through google maps. You could clearly see its color is different from two sides. source: [Korda Thinking Tackle OD 4 EP2: Danny Fairbrass & Darrell Peck | Carp Fishing 2021](https://youtu.be/UpvKqrCXKqM?t=666)</cite>

Generaly you want your fish spot is closing to snags or something with structure(weed、fallen/sunken trees、overhanging vegetation or rocks) that provide safer places to hide for a school of fish instead of open water. In summer, the fish might spread all over the water and location might not be that important, but in winter, they tend to school up and it is up to you to find the fish. Carp fact: carp is cold-blooded therefore their movements and the activity is dictated by on water temperature.

Also carp are spooky and very sensitive to noise, which is why most anglers here prefer to fish at evening or night in summertime as much as they can depsite of some anoying nocturnal animals like bugs and insects and possibly snakes. Generally you want to stay away from those swims with high angling pressures from the bank.

![](/assets/carp_fishing_en1/reservior_shape.jpg)

The south side is the deep water area with mountains sliding into water very sharply, that north side is kinda shallow full of debris left from submerged rice field. Most local anglers will pick the south side with deeper open-water and less snags but kinda rocky at the margin, and I barely see anyone fishing on the rice field side. But I decided to go from the rice field side where I heard a big sound of fish jumping. Other reasons are: 

 1. Even though it has snags like debris of rotten rice plants,  it doesn't do that much damage comparing to rocky strucuture , considering it is unmanned and unattended. When fish got the bite, felt the pain(I'm not sure it is called pain, I guess "danger" is better here?), it is gonna drag the line to whereever it felt safe - which mostly is full of snags or deep water so to say. A rocky structure would be much easier to cut the line due to its sharpness than some softy rotten debris could. I forgot to mention I bought 100 meter long braide fishing line of line size 8 with 8 strands - maybe 4 strands is even better here - which should provide a pretty good abrasion resistance aganist aquatic plants.

 2. Helicopter or chod rig could help lift up the hook from lake bed and present nicely without being buried in the debris.


### Water Depth

Knowing how deep the water is can be essential to fishing. Often we've heard people saying: "The deeper the better", for deep water could hide big size fish. Also some says " You should pick margins - where shallow water meets deeper water - a sharp drop-off or deep channel". Some says "in winter/autumn, go for deep, in spring&summer, go for shallow". There are lots of different and even contradictory views in regard to depth. Our experience tells us that water depth relates to water temperature and oxgen content. But what's relationship between those those? There are lots of water depth on fishing activity research on internet , for example, [Effects of Water Temperature and Depth on the Catch Rate and Catch per Unit Effort for Mirror Carp (Cyprinus carpio) caught by Gillnets](http://researcherslinks.com/current-issues/Effects-Water-Temperature-Depth-Catch-Rate-Catch-Unit-Effort-Mirror-Carp-Cyprinus-carpio-caught-Gillnets/20/1/441/html), could shed some light. Also it shows that relationship is pretty complex and can be subject to changes of other factors. In summer, surface of water is warm, the bottom is cold; but in winter, it is the opposite. 

Generally big size prefer to stay in some depth for the safety but shallow water  -like close to the bank-is more likely to hold more food sources. Some underwater diving videos shows that some fish like to stay in some depth with some structure to hide. That depth depends on water quality、overall water depth in the lake and seasons. You better talk to local angers to get idea about overal depth like how deep is deepest part. 

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code. 

All of that seems reasonable but kinda abstract though, can we put some digital/electronic tracking devices/tags on the carps and track its activity, just like tracking whales via satellite tags([Whale Telemetry Group](https://mmi.oregonstate.edu/wtg)), to hopefully get some insights on its behavior? Big data is the hype, how about some big data from carps?

![](https://blog-1255311287.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/20211002fishingpart2/carp_location_season.jpeg)

<cite>source: IFishMan Youtube: [Wie verhalten sich Großkarpfen in einem natürlichen Gewässer? Hier der August
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXRsnoPy4zw&ab_channel=IFishMan). I highly recommend checking other videos of this youtube channel even though it is in German. Pay attention to its experimentatal conditions.</cite>

Here is some graphcs that germany fishery lab did on a nature water pond/lake. They marked different types of fish with different electronic tags(show in different colors), track their signals of activity across the whole year and got some interesting data to analyze for its behavior. For example, in winter, you might think the fish will hide in the deepest part of lake, but it turns out they all huddle together on the shallow border (Reminiscence of ...a stock operator - oops, no -the winter time of my elementary school - we all huddle together and push/squeeze each other at the corner of classroom in a american football way to just get a little bit warmer. kinda like [Passenger Squeezes Onto Tokyo Subway During Rush Hour
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R0FanSTyOw&ab_channel=Storyful) and this [People stuffed onto a train in Tokyo, Japan (train stuffing Tokyo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7kor5nHtZQ&ab_channel=TheFatFinger) :)


Another interesting observation,  we might think as the temperature and oxygen levels drops to the lowest point during the midnight, to that extent, that fish will simply stop all kindas activity -  Sleeping Ariadne, a statue of sluggish. However the graphic shows they actually are still moving around during what we perceived as "the worst time of day".

That just shows how we by defaut just like to put carp in ourselves shoes. What you think fish should do based on your personal/human experience and feeling != what fish does in its own way. You can't know what fish is thinking(suppose it has a thinking in whatever you might named it  - dao/god/natura naturans), instead you could only guess from their behaviors. That's always a good reminder esp when you're watching those commercials touting how good they are.


In my case, the depth of the mountain side is like 5-6 meters deep from about 4-5 meters close to bank. It could even deeper farther way. On the other side , the shallow side, is like 2-3 meters deep from 4-5 meters - since I only do pole fish  and never use surf rod before. I have no idea about what's depth of 20-30 - 50 meters away. Given what I know, it seems that 3-8 meters depth could be a good starting point for winter from shallow side to try out first.

About the methods to plumb the depths, no advanced Sonar or Depth Finder or Fish Finder needed, just use old-fashioned way in cane pole fishing - fishing line with a sinker and a bobble float - cast out a couple of times and adjust bobble's position along the line to get a ballpark. It is simple and cheap to do but just a little bit time-consuming.


### Distance

Along the previsouly mentioned old saying "The deeper the better", there is another saying "The further the better". And it does make some sense. If you have done pole fishing before, then you know, that the longer the rod and line, the higher chance you could catch big size fish. Why? because often the closer to bank, typically the shallower the water would be, espec in day time, more noisy it would be. But how far it should be? is it the further the better? Well not always, you also need think in terms of whole lakebed shape and surrounding conditions from a bird's-eye view.


![](https://blog-1255311287.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/20211002fishingpart2/winter_veune.jpeg)

<cite>Fox Carp Fishing Youtube: [CARP FISHING IN WINTER (Catch more on cold days)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUdfbnZ_Qu4&ab_channel=FoxInternationalCarpFishing)</cite>


In above picture, the center of lake is deeper than the ones close to be bank. But it is not the best one to fish in the wintertime as it doesn't have any covers. Covers like reeds/lotus/trees could provide warmer shelter comparing to the open water. Even if you couldn't find any covers, and it is not necessary to just focus on the distance - you have to think about the depth and other factors. 

It is not uncommon for some surfrod anglers just to rush to start fishing - in a hurry to put up bait, cast out extremely long distance without much thought as soon as they arrived at the lake. Afterwards they spend lots of time waiting on the bank, yet they didn't wanna just spend a few casts to test out the water depth and conditions beforehand. They just go there, mount the hookbait and cast out whereever they want, then just wait like "I'm done with work on my side, it is the fish - your turn to bite". Yes, they still coud get a bite from fish and caught it from time to time, but just no consistency could be gained.

Think about 100 meters far away with depth of 30 centermeters vs 50 meters away with depth of 3 meters given we know the basic depths of this lake. What's the chances of big size carp showing up in those two cases?

It is important to cast out a couple of rods to test depth around the target fish spot - left,right, front or back -  to get a better idea about the lakebed shape neary the spot , is it flat, a slope or sharpe drop-off or basin? Don't exaggerate one factor too much - you really dont need to cast out to 150 meters away most of the time.

Cane pole fishing has one advantage over fishing with rod & reels, that is it is pretty easier to get cast out accurely in the pretty much same spot. Any deviation on the bank could be magnified many folds in 20,30,50 even 100 meters away. So you need practice casting techniques to gain some accuracy and there are lots of tutorials on the internet. You dont' need exact same spot, some offset is perfectine fine. For me, It didn't took me long to  be able to cast accurenty like 30 meter disnace with 1-3 meters radius in that vicinity.I found it is extemly useful to record the moves of your casting in video. You could see your posture,movmenet and adjust accordingly - [The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740) - what you think of yourself is probably not what you really are. 

Also it help you get a great detail on the lakebed condition of fish spot  - is it gravel、rocky or weedy or silty? How you gonna choose right rig strategy for it. Fish might get sacred and flee away by the sound of lead hitting the water surface, but some underwater video experiment shows those fish will slowly get back to search for the food. It is not a big deal in my case, as I have lots of time and patience for it while chilling cozily out at home with heating on and drinking my Longjing/Dragon Well tea - vibe 😎🤞 :)

I have chosen the distance like 20-30 meters far away from the bank. And 2.7 meters long rod with 5000 reel did a pretty good job considering the thickness of the fihsing line(line size 8). Since my focus is on fish's nocturnal behaviors, and night is quieter than day time, also based on what I know from above depth section, hence my assumption is that big fish will be morely likely to go to shallow water that close to bank where it could have more food to feed.


### Baiting/Feeding


Basically how could we attract the fish into the swim? Well, the fish use mostly following senses to detect and indentify whehter something is good to eat or not : smell、taste、sight. Fish have a pretty good olfactory system to sense any dissolved substance in the water ,and they could recognize the smell of  amino acids and others having nutritional value. It has showed that carp has thousands of chemoreceptors in their mouth on their barbels and even on the outside of their mouth and under their chin down to their neck. Chemoreception - They could taste, esp for carp, they sucks in a big mouth of silt and other detritus -  when they smell or feel via taste buds from their barbules, pectoral and pelvic fins of the eatable like bloodworm/corn etc - palatal taste organ in the mouth trap the food against the bottom of the mouth and expell non-food through gills(almost 90% got ejected). Also they have sensitive eyes, could see in lower light levels under the water and detetct changes in light and movement above the water - so camouflage like Rambo, be stealth, anglers! However, their habit of feeding in the sediments on the bottom searching for small buried food items has required them to rely on highly developed senses of smell and taste.


Generally the feeding habit of carp is most fixed and stable like routine - eat what is plentiful - but sometime they will break it or at least try to discover new food sources. It is a dynamic process. Mostly stable-better chance, sometimes dynamic - slim chance. Consider that the reservoir which has lots of rice field/reed/mulberry tree around it, then most likely the rice/reed/mulbeery will get you better chance to get a bite consistently comparing to other food like corn that fish never see it before. On the other hand, if you prefeeding the same spot with lots of new food source ,for example corn,  regularly over a long period of time, the feeding behavior of fish might change accordingly. The carp is not one-track minded, they're open to adapt their feeding habit if it works.

With those being said, it is always good to spend sometime beforehand looking at the surrounding of fishing location、talking to local angler to get a good idea about what kinda feeding/baiting feed are best for. Some anglers boast about the effectiveness of some baits with certain flavors or scents. They tend to promote and show how good they are based on their experience so it must be good for others too,  without realizing it could be just a cognitive trap or bais: `"Rules for me, not for thee"`.

How do they define whether it is good or not? I saw lots of angler smell the bait, but come on, you need also taste the bait too, but no one did that :)  If the bait smells good for them, then they will think it could attract more fish than those which smells bad. Even though the way that those molecules trasmitting through air is different from those trasmitting through water, let alone different receptors and mechanism between human being and fish. `sola dosis facit venenum` - how much is the approriate one to be defined as a natural flavor and scent level for the fish? It should have some range, isn't it?
Is it always "the more the better"? To how much it could just backfire? Some flavors or scents or chemicals which works well for fish in separate form, but when got mixed together could have a totally negative effect on the fish.

Some [Wu Wei/Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) wisdom and a saying from Jesse Livemore - *Money is made by sitting, not trading*,  if you don't know the mechanisam and its chemical of all those additives, then dont' add it. You don't need to react to that urge to take any excrescent action do sth extra to give your more pseudo aka "Out of Thin Air" confidence or just make you feel better. How? by cultivating some awareness to learn more about yourself.

Feel the same urge of just imitating or copying whatever those glowing/shining masters do in the videos, no need to look up to them and blindly accept everything from what they say. Put everything on the table and examine it, debunk some myth from those chrismastic authority in a logic way. For bait, you could use homemade ones with lots of options like panko、bread crumb、instant oat meal、grits、cereal、bird seeds、feed corns、grains mixing with some jello gelatin/molasses/beer. Those are natural ingredients and cheap and easy to find. Sweetcorn is very juciy and perfect for fishing during summer. Sweetcorn is my favorite and you could buy the canned sweetcorn and cream for the winter. Boilies are also pretty good which made of doughs - easy to keep,no stinks, convient - it keeps small fish away and help you catch the big size fish.You could also buy commercial ones and it is not big deal. I'not a contemporary cynicism and hate every commercials.I do like the style and franknesss from [Adam Penning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLiArMvlfpg&ab_channel=CARPologyTVCarpFishing) among other carp anglers.


Back to my case, rice - from obervation of rcie field, and feed corn (or maize) -  from local anglers, is picked as candidates for the carp bait. Cleary I don't want wait for hours to get small nuisance fish bite , so the rice or pellets or small particles will be excluded. Since I'm gonna leave it under the water for 1-2 days(no rebait), those bait shouldn't be easily dissovled or lose its liveness like live bait. So no pack bait/method feeder is gonna be used here. Big solid particle like feed corn(its hard kernel) is a perfect fit and most important part is it is on a budget and so simple to prepare. Buy some feed corn, soak it and boil it, if you'd like - not necessary- could try experiment by adding some molasses or alcohols like Baileys or Tsingtao beer or hemp oil later.(Who knows! I have some Turmeric&Curry&Coriander&Garam masala powder left from last time trying cook indian food, and I might add those to test out). One downside of it is that adding those sugar or powder additives could make corn ferment quickly and rot faster.

After picked the bait for feeding, next thing is about the feeding strategy. Obiviously most reasonable one is to take little bit time to just chum some baits to same spot every day(like one week or one month) before you really get your rods out and start fishing. But is is impossible for me as I only got 4-7 days holiday break and I really dont' want spend too much time on the bank to fish - I only got one hour break each day to go outdoors for fishing(family first) - that's exactly why I come up with an idea about auto carp fishing. To make it up, I decide to choose one fishing spot and bait there instead of moving around the lake on the bank. Here is my two cents on how to effectively attract fish in big nature water by feeding/baiting:

<img src="/assets/carp_fishing_en1/dawo_en.jpeg" style="zoom:67%;display:flex" />


Basically we have the fish spot in the center, and feeding, i.e - corn- is evenly scattered around it forming a cricle with 3-5 meter radius. Loose chumming could possibly attract further fishes in a longer distance than precise baiting, as it could cover bigger and wider water area by its falvors and scents. Then we use pva bags or pva mesh to precisely bait right in the center this circle. Well this seems pretty ideal, the tricky part is how to get chumming like what hands can do but in a longer distance ? Slingshot、Spod、 pva bags/mesh、 gaint throwing sticks/baiting spoon even fishing bait boat couldn't do that easily.

<cite>Self-made Spod: a Gatorade-like bottle、a lead and some glues.</cite>

In above picture and videos, that is a home-made spod with bottle and a lead. You could see that the corns inside the bottle will be detached from the lead/sinker beneath it as it is falling and is about to hit the water. Those dry corns has a lighter weight comparing to the lead and will split out and be scattered into the water - inside a circle of radius like 3-5 meters. The downside is the baiting inside it need to be light/dry and also it won't cast out very far away given its bad aerodynamic shape. But it fits my case - actually that's exactly my intention to not fish from a very long distance - a good compromise.


### Rigs 

A quick recap on the fish tackles : 2.7 meters long rod($4~24RMB)、5000 reel($3-$4~20RMB")、braided line with size of 8 and 8 strands($2~12RMB)、a slim bobber float($1~6RMB)、80g~2.8oz sinker($0.5~3RMB)、 hair rig of big size 4 circle hook with pop-ups buoyant bait、smaller size 7 Izu Iseni hook for bottom bait with feed corn. To be honest, I have some doubt on using fake bait like plastic corn as bait even thought it has a great advanage here: Fish couldn't steal it and no need to rebait the hook.

Only middle part of China in Sichuan and Chongqing use similar fake bait, but not my hometown or province - like never. Most people here rarely use any kinda pop-ups bait or circle hook, instead they are inclined to use bottom bait with iseni hook for big-size fish. For people fishing with pole, they only use maximum two hooks for each. However for people fishing with rod and reel, they just use a fewww hooks. Let's take a look at two most frequently used hook patterns:

 串钩 or 爆炸钩 图片
 ps1: I guess in us/uk it is called something like gang/party hooks? [(Christmas party in Downing Street while London was in strict lockdown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfTsLjdb3Mc&ab_channel=CNN) :) 
 ps2: update - later I found it is called sth like flapper or clipped down rig for sea fishing as it is illegal to have more 2 hooks for freshwater in uk?
 
The logic is pretty straightforward: more hooks more bites. Despite of the so-claimed moral superiority of using fewer hooks from some people - as long as it doesn't voilate the local regulations, I don't see any problem with that. On the flip side of more hooks is that it means hooks has higher chances getting trapped in snags or structure forms like rocks/reefs/weed when angler cast out or play the fish. If you use it in open water which has less snags and have a pretty good understanding on the condition of the lakebed, then go for it. But I have mountain reserovir with lots of snags like rocks and weed, plus a design of non-attended angling, so multi-hooks seems not a good option. Ideally one hook but as I said, I never use pop-up bait with fake corn before, so I want to do a experiment and compare it with common bottom bait with feed corn side by side. Even though techniquely fish is not `eating` the fake plastic corn but more like `chewing` - they just try out the possible food through their mouth and expell it out, I'm still very curious to just, by myself, to catch some fishes in order to test out popular saying:  "If I dont' eat plastics, how come fish will eat it ?"

I'm using pvg bags to embed the hook with bottom bait. Since I have two hooks and with differnet line length, in order to not tangle with each other, I intentionly not put the inline lead into pvg bag - it also give more room for bait. Then how to prevent the pva bag fall off the line when casting out (the bag is heavy with corns)? I use a hook snap to hook the top of bag(the tie part) to the swivel. Just tie off the top of pva bag with extra licks and twist it is strong enough to hold the strength of gravity from hook snap when casting, because by this design, the force is not applied to the fishing line but on the hook snap. I test it a couple of times and it works pretty good. I have bottom hook presented nicely blending with a pile of corn bait, and a pop-up hook that are a few centermeters away from it. After watching some underwater fishing feeding videos, it looks like big carp always start with outside from the periemter cautionously. I am really intrigued to know which hook it is gonna pickup first in my case.

Apart from adding more hooks to increase the odds, adding more rods could also get greater chance - 3 rods looks good (no matter how great your setup your rig and how fmailiar you're with the lakebed conditions, it could still happen that your lines and hooks got tangled when casting or got a bad presentation somehow when landing on the lakebed).

# Wrap-up

In this article we have covered the angling strategy that we're gonn ause for the carp fishing , tailed to the unique fishing scenario and non-attended fishing style. Those are the buildingblocks for next chapter, which we're gonna elaborate on device - how to setup the trigger, read whether got a bite from fish and call my cellphone to notify.


TODO: 保证鱼不容脱钩发力

* 泄力 - 比如弹簧 或者橡皮筋 rubber band or fabric latex
* 铅坠 - 活动 - 这样鱼不会那么会摆动
* 缓冲 - 加多10米的线在岸上 冬天鱼的活力没那么好 metabolism
* open water, less snags or structure (rock formations/too much weedy)
