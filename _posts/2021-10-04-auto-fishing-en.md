Auto carp fishing



Why?

* winter - cold freezing ?(bivvy not even good enough)
* not that much time for day session ? (need work and away from big city)
* second half of the night (00:00 - 07:00)  - what's the behzvior carp ? any bite ? how likely ? what's temperature curve? , too dangerous and cold to sleep outside （传统观念：都说冬天鱼冷些动物，新城代谢低，那么下半夜了，温度的低的时候，会不会有草鲤鱼上钩了？）It is said that larger fishes are more active at night and dawn.
* free water ? big lake nature water  ( not small pond or paid fishery or syndicate)
* simple bait will work ? no need for test complext bait or chemicals ? (magots for winter, boillet for summer ?) - corn (nothhing more, just corn)


My angling background:  pole fishing but not that much expierence, no ice in winter

in china, pole fish is the prevailing fish style. People like the feeling of fish's pwoer transmiting via line /rod all the way to the hand.(tremors). It is like a monster on your pole and feel of fighting with the fish is so wicked and satisfying when I got a grass carp  like 7-8 lb using 5.4 meters long pole and sweet corn.

Reservoir - The lake is very big like hundreds of acres. no one is feeding those fish, the fish is pretty much on its own, so the density is kinda low, not like high-stocked recreational fishery or syndicate. The local fishery resource in China, in general, is pretty bad. Some people uses all kinds of destructive fishing practices to catch the fish - e.g - electro、net of mesh with small hole、firecrackers. In nature water, the fishery resource is mostly damaged to a extent that fish that with weight over 1.5Kg ~ 2.5KG could be called - BIG size fish. There are some fish with weight over 20kg - 50kg (last time, one of my friend caught a carp fish with 12KG using pole rod in reservoir), but that's pretty rare. The type of carp here is almost all grass/common with super super rarely you could get a mirror, let alone any black/scaly carp type.

Here is some image in the lake. For big fish, people are angling with 8.1 meters - 10 meter long pole rod, prefeed/bait with feed corns like every day in the same swim of the lake, then fish at the that day. For samll fish, 2.7m, 3.6m, 4.5m is pretty common. They try to fish further away from the bank at the side closing to the mountains - which is much deeper comparing to the opposite shallow side.

By talking with local anglers , they said the big fish is very hard to catch, usually they could caught one , bigger one after several days of waiting.  They need prefeed regulary with large mount of corn(fermented, homemade or bought ), extremely patient when fishing(long time of boring wait for the bite)、also extremely concentraction on the bobble floater. 

But once they got the bite, the feeling is so rewarding that previous efforts and boring wating is allll worthy it. Esp for pole fishing, picking up the rod、 jerking the line 、 pull it hard and setting the hook when you saw the marker float suddely dipped in then play/fight the fish, the feeling of tremors pass through the line,  adrenaline inside you,  that  is most exciting part of angling.

However fishing with rods and reels has a great adavnage for big size fish over fishing with pole. It could cast out a longer distance and possibly reach out to more fishes. Another important advice from veteran anglers is that you better pick a quiet time to fish as they are spooky and sensitive to any noise from the bank. 

I still remember when I was a kid, I use self-made bamboo pole and earthworm that digged out of my backyard to catch fish which is pretty effective and simple. Nowdays it is jaw-dropping to know that fishing gears and equiments are getting so complicted and segemnted,coming with so many variations. Take a look at the pole fish gears in China and correspondings in West:

For pole fishing: A 7.2 meter telescopic pole is at least 300 RMB for moderate quality, 1000RMB0-2000RMB for good ones.They are tons of components and accessories: [fishing platform](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002382124941.html)、[multifunctional fishing box](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003307267441.html)、[fishing bucket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000096264484.html)、[fishing chair](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003186497852.html)、[fish umbrella/brolly](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002868486443.html)、fishing bag etc.

Those gears add up lots of weight and they are not easy to carry around. Look the mountains and rice field around that revoriro, I'm pretty sure by the time I got to the bank, I'm already exhausted. I thought the chinese way is somehow maximalistic. Guess what? Western carp fish is just a little bit more maximalistic :)

ps: Meister Eckhart - The more we have the less we own.


ps just take a look tat those brnad website and its price - dman, it is not for budget aka rip off

take a look at the budget products from [Fox Tradeshow 2021 | CARP FISHING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-rYz0MuhE&t=200s&ab_channel=FoxInternationalCarpFishing) 


A wheelbarrow - I thought angling is about minimlistic and keep it simple, until some Fox/Korda/Nash/Gardner/Mainline angler of carp fish comes with a wheelbarrow and point to all kindas gears(mat、bivvy、CAMO COOL BAGS, bait belts, coffee maker、tea press、kettle、stove、dinner set and cookare sets etc) inside it smirking and saying:  "oh my gawd, dear comrade，my young bloke, how dare you? I'm the true minimalist - just one item".


Surely, good equiqments tackles and gears could bring better angling epxerince, some edges and more comfotaable when angling - unless you know what're doing. Like a double-edged sword, it comes with pros and cons. Those equiqtmens really make it so cumbersome to move around, even demoralizing, just take a look the moutains and rice field in my case - how steep the slope is in moutain side and how close those rice fields are laid out next to each other like a grid.

ps: don't tell me that somebody fancy carrying a barrow of big/heavy gears around when they fish here


Those commerical tackle compainies mainly targets recreational fishery like pond or farm-raised syndicate, not for wild fishing. Isn't recreational fishing supposed to be simple , lightweight and relaxing instead of a ...a barrow? Early Churchch Fathers and later Meister Eckhart, must feel kinda of offended by the Roman Curia's long and boring church services , ceremonies and rites (In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritu Sancti. Amen - people just couldn't bear with it, so much so that they coined a word in Spanish for it: santiamén).

Unless you're professional angler or anglers that have a lot of time, just fishing for the fun and blending in with nature to be like a Dionysian of Nietzsche during precious break, then fishing in wild water is the way to go and really no need for top-notch gears/baits to get started.

Here is my humble opion on why?

## Fishing Explained 

>  “In our reasonings, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance—from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence. A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence.” - David Hume


Fishing is not rocket science(see [hard science and soft science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science)). It is pretty much like sociology and economics - dealing with probability and statistics. it is very hard to do a controlled experiment because there are simply too many factors involved and isolation becames pretty much impossilbe to do so. That's a pretty important shift in perspective, just like investment and sports, from 100% certainty to uncertainty and odds of randomness.

(冰山图片)

	Catch Rate = water temperature + barometric pressure +sunny/cloudy + wind(Windward/leeward) + season/timing + water bodies(pond/rivers/lakes vs still/flowing/creek/current) + waterbed(gravel/weedy) + terrain(depth/basin/drop off) + food source + bait flavors/scents + speice of fish + ... 

There is just a idffernet level of randomness. 

Factors above the iceber are the ones we could observe from our expericences. Some factors are more general and universal, some are quite idfferent to differente speices of fish. Those are the ones at least we could study and learn to figure something plausible out like patterns to improve our chances. To some extent, fishing is a bit rocket science and you can do your homework with reasoning. You can get wisdom and theories from reading books、watching videos、taking with expirenced anglers - very effective way to build up your understanding about the fishing. A good example would be fish anatomy and behaviors patterns - know the fish you're angling at - is it bottom fishing or surface fishing? what water column it prefers? how it feeds? how it find foods? what temperature it likes? etc. Even for carp, there are so many different kinds of carp and its behavior might vary a lot, e.g, it would be extremely low chance to use corn what grass carp likes a lot to get any bighead carp a bite. There are some nice carp underwater fishing compilations on Youtube like [Underfishing
- Best carp underwater fishing compilation 2020 (High quality)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGKLmPr6kSg&ab_channel=Underfishing) showing how carp got caught in front of camera.

The iceber under the water is a big X - sometimes we called it "luck" - it shows the limits of our knowledge.Its randomness is beyond our undstanding. It reminds us the our logic/reasoning that built on top of it is inherently not that stable as we might think and open to changes from undernethat it. Hence we could answer some question like "what one single factor could stand out significatnlty over thoses in this equation?"  The answer is no.  Unless you fish in a controlled fine-tunned condition like a vaccum pond, you might have one factor over others. But that justa pplied to taht specific case,and it would be practically impossible to actually determine with wild fishing.

No silver bullet for software enginering, no magic chart pattern of technical analysis for investment, no magic bait, no super bait. Additionaly it reveals that those best practices or golden tips or rules of thumbs from others are just their summary of their past expiernce which are not tested by your personal experince. Their context might be(for sure)  differnet from yours subjectively and objectively. You can have two same icebergs, arn't you? 


To turn other people's experience and theory(outside) to yours(innerizing), you need to do it by yourself, in your own personal expericen. How? through trial and error and learn from it, remember no books or videos and nothing could substitute for your personal experience. Dont'get me wrong, those guidances serve greately as a starting point or sth to fallback on when you just have no clue, but never it should be taken as doctine or sth forever true. Fishing is dynamic process and just about being personal. If you want consistency in longer time over randomness, then you cant count on the bginner's luck or finding some magic shortcut. You should do your homework - for example like what Joel Greenblat said in [<<The Little Book That Beats the Market>>](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Still-Beats-Market/dp/0470624159) -  and put in effects and times will build it up. Once we know the probability - nature of randomness, get yourself right in one go by buying expenive stuff from or imtating those - in Max Weber's term, [Charismatic authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_authority) alike - masters displayed in the videos of commerical tackle companies simply not gonna work. You want do trial and error many times in a budge and affordable way to figure out your fishing style and strategy that fits your specfic case.

It sounds like software development/lean startup/investment and other things, the idea is same: keep agile, fail fast, embracing changes. 

> Do your homework(Foundamentals) + Luck
> 
> dedicated + open minded

The dyanmic and probabilistic nature of fishing process means you need prepare yourself up with a good mindset. Sometimes, you not doing your homework but still great luck, turning out to be a good catch. At some other times, you did your homework hardly but no luck turning out to be fruitless, a blank. That blank is very common for fising big size fish in nature wild water, like [gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) for studying human behavior in sociology, just think about how many extremely tall guys you have met. To illustrate that, I put a  [Galton Board]() to get an idea of the normal distribution emerge from a random drop of ball-bearings.

[图片Galton Board】
ps: next time, when you buy lottery and hope to win, ask yourself this: Am I gonna get struck by lightning right now?

Big size fishes are more spooky and pretty smart in nature water. Just like anglers need put in work and wait for all planets to align to get a bite, those fishes also need have all the X factors aligned perfectly to growing to that size.

The unpredictability is sth you can't control, but the process is sth you can contrl  kinda of and be enjoyed. Angling always has offered something to learn about, through it , you learn not just that - fishing outside -  but also yourself, and build up some awareness of your person identiy (self) and appreicate and reconnect with the beauty and serenity of the nature. To me, I personally like fishing in nature water, and that is really relaxing.

So I'd suggest those commerical tackle companies could put one-liner as a disclaimer to show their frankness/deep respect/sincere care for fishing in their promotion videos on the youtube: `"It depends!"`


## Fishing Scenario

some requirements and conditions of this fishing case: 

* reservoir : low stocked big nature water - wild water
* target: big size fish with 1.5KG - 15KG 
* time:  1-2 days consecutive
* unmanned/unattended:  automatical
* baiting/feeding strategy: pre-baiting/feeding once and no halfway baiting/feeding
* secretiveness:  detecting device should be small enough to be camouflaged and not easily be able to spot from the bank
* mobility : device and whole fish tackle should be easily to be assemble or dis-assemble

Quick Summary: prebait and hook the bait, cast out, take down the fishing line from reel, knot with tent pegs on the bank. Then setup the bite detecting device, link the trigger between fishing line and device. Leave it for 1-2 days. When got bite from fish,  the strength of fish fleeing way on the fishing line, will trigger alarm, hence give a call to my phone so that I could just go there and pickup and land the fish. 

But we also need some hearbeat to know that device is running properly. Every one minutes,  it send a http request to my backend server which log its timstamp and whether it got triggered or not.  With this data,  later we could know what time it got bite and what temperature it is.

Keywwords: wild water、big-size carp、automatical, winter、night and dawn(fish behavior).

Why I got this idea at the begining? : I have seen lots of local anglers(some of my friends) spending lots of time on the bank just waiting for bite using pole. And in carp fishing of UK/US this got little bit better with bivvy/coffee maker/cookware etc esp in the ranning and snowing days but just too cumbersome&expensive to carry around. Still stay up whole night in the wild doesn't seem to be a relaxing and comfortable experience. Fishing in the second half of night is pretty rare to see and possible a quite new territory to explore just out of my curiosity. That's eaxctly why I got this idea: non-attened carp fishing. 

Before I jump right to the automatical part - trigger device and how it works, like an old sayings "A beard well lathered is half shaved", I need analyze what kinda fishing strategy would fit in overall big picture ().

## Fishing Strategy

I learned many tips and techniques from enourpean carp fishing through videos and books. However carp fishing in China, esp wild carp in wild water - in my case a big reservior - its behaviors are quite idfferent from enourpean style as Enourpean are primarily fishing in stocked ponds either commercial fishery or sydnicate that farm-raised carp has no predators. The fishing resource in China is worse than the US. I have watched some US carp fishing vidoes(some chinese people cane poling in Califormnia and catch lots of carp fish with good size) , which its wild water is more simmilar to my case but the density there is still much higher than here. I dare challenge those carp fishings masters come to China and test themselves on the real battlefield :)

As said previsouly, there is no secret bait, no magic gear that will surely give you a bite. Even if you have best rod and reel、most expensive bait、fanciest and most elegant barrow in the world, all that stuff doesn't make a lick of differnce if you're not putting your bait in front of the fish.

One big factor of consistent catch is just find where fish are, esp in the winter. Location is crucial!

### Swim/Location

The first thing you need is to analyze the terrain of where you fish - read water. Either take a walk aroud the water area, or searching its google map statelite image, or asking from local angler, just try figure out the general terrain of water you're gonna angle at. No rush to drop you rods. For picking the right swim/spot, it is always good to have direct eyesight of fish rollover or bubbles from stiring mud. 

Generaly you want your fish spot is closing to snags or something with structure(weed、fallen/sunken trees 、overhanging vegetation or rocks) that provide safer places to hide for a school of fish instead of open water. In summer, the fish might spread all over the water and location might not be that important, but in winter, they tend to school up and it is up to you to find the fish. Carp fact: carp is cold-blooded therefore their movements and the activity is dictated by on water temperature.

Also carp are spooky and very sensitive to noise, which is why most anglers here prefer to fish at evening or night in summertime as much as they can depsite of some anoying nocturnal animals like bugs and insects and possibly snakes. Generally you want to stay away from those swims with high angling pressures from the bank.

(here is the lake genenral shape ) 标识点位 钓点
图片 0- fishing 地图 （选位置）

The left side is the deep water area with mountains sliding into water very sharply, that right side is kinda shallow  full of debris left from submerged rice field. Most local anglers will pick the left side with deeper open-water and less snags but kinda rocky at the margin, and I barely see anyone fishing on the rice field side. But I decided to go from the rice field side where I heard a big sound of fish jumping. Other reasons are: 

 1. Even though it has snags like debris of rotten rice plants,  it doesn't do that much damage comparing to rocky strucuture , considering it is unmanned and unattended. When fish got the bite, felt the pain(I'm not sure it is called pain, I guess "danger" is better here?), it is gonna drag the line to whereever it felt safe - which mostly is full of snags or deep water so to say. A rocky structure would be much easier to cut the line due to its sharpness than some softy rotten debris could. I forgot to mention I bought 100 meter long braide fishing line of line size 6 with 8 strands - maybe 4 strands is even better here - which should provide a pretty good abrasion resistance aganist aquatic plants.

 2. Helicopter or chod rig could help lift up the hook from lake bed and present nicely without being buried in the debris.


### Water Depth

Knowing how deep the water is can be essential to fishing. Often we've heard people saying: "The deeper the better", for deep water could hide big size fish. Also some says " You should pick margins - where shallow water meets deeper water - a sharp drop-off or deep channel". Some says "in winter/autumn, go for deep, in spring&summer, go for shallow". There are lots of different and even contradictory views in regard to depth. Our experience tells us that water depth relates to water temperature and oxgen content. But what's relationship between those those? There are lots of water depth on fishing activity research on internet , for example, [Effects of Water Temperature and Depth on the Catch Rate and Catch per Unit Effort for Mirror Carp (Cyprinus carpio) caught by Gillnets](http://researcherslinks.com/current-issues/Effects-Water-Temperature-Depth-Catch-Rate-Catch-Unit-Effort-Mirror-Carp-Cyprinus-carpio-caught-Gillnets/20/1/441/html), could shed some light. Also it shows that relationship is pretty complex and can be subject to changes of other factors. In summer, surface of water is warm, the bottom is cold; but in winter, it is the opposite. 

Generally big size prefer to stay in some depth for the safety but shallow water  -like close to the bank-is more likely to hold more food sources. Some underwater diving videos shows that some fish like to stay in some depth with some structure to hide. That depth depends on water quality、overall water depth in the lake and seasons. You better talk to local angers to get idea about overal depth like how deep is deepest part. 

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code. 

All of that seems reasonable but kinda abstract though, can we put some digital/electronic tracking devices/tags on the carps and track its activity, just like tracking whales via satellite tags([Whale Telemetry Group](https://mmi.oregonstate.edu/wtg)), to hopefully get some insights on its behavior? Big data is the hype, how about some big data from carps?

(Fishery genemry carp fish telemetry IFishman)
ps: Fishery germany 

Here is some graphcs that germany fishery lab did on a nature water pond/lake. They marked different types of fish with different electronic tags(show in different colors), track their signals of activity across the whole year and got some interesting data to analyze for its behavior. For example, in winter, you might think the fish will hide in the deepest part of lake, but it turns out they all huddle together on the shallow border (Reminiscence of ...a stock operator - oops, no -the winter time of my elementary school - we all huddle together and push/squeeze each other at the corner of classroom in a american football way to just get a little bit warmer. kinda like [Passenger Squeezes Onto Tokyo Subway During Rush Hour
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R0FanSTyOw&ab_channel=Storyful) and this [People stuffed onto a train in Tokyo, Japan (train stuffing Tokyo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7kor5nHtZQ&ab_channel=TheFatFinger) :)


Another interesting observation,  we might think as the temperature and oxygen levels drops to the lowest point during the midnight, to that extent, that  fish will simply stop all kindas activity -  statue of sluggish. However the graphic shows they actually are still moving around during what we perceived as "the worst time of day".

That just shows how we project what we think on behalf of the fish. What you think fish should do != what fish does on its own. You can't know what fish is thinking(suppose it has a thinking in whatever you might named it  - dao/god/natura naturans), instead you could only guess from their behaviors.  To anaylze behaviors and actions,  we could borrow from Francias Bacon's scientifc method.  Namely put our prejudices 、preconception and old sayings/claims under inspection, careful observation on the fact,   tabulation and classification on factors that possibly lead to the fact，setup experiments to verify etc - investigative method to form a empirical study which not based on ideas and theories. don't get me wrong，I'm not saying that you should overwhelm yourself with everything by yourself (the earth is flat)- some you could stand on the shoulder of gaint.  A good way is to identify what's [hard science and soft science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science).  Angling is pretty much like sociology and economics, it is very hard to do a controlled experiment - there are simply too many factors involved and isolation becames pretty much impossilbe to do. You could angle with same bait/same fish tackle, in same swim , in same season and pretty much same sunny day, same temperature/wind from weather report, but very likely you have different results - to say the least - maybe a full fishing keepnet or just blank - never you got same result.

From my experience and ponder-over, sometimes , as angler, maybe we need shift our perspective from chasing after certaintiy(conventional wisdom) to getting along with probability and statistics - i.e - uncertaninty. I will elaborate more on this in following secions.

However shifted to thinking in terms of probabiliy and statistics, doesn't mean  you dont' wahter you want to or just being clueless like headless chicken or dont need any logic and reasoning. Well, quite to the contrary, you need do your homework(If there is one silverbullet) like what Joel Greenblat said in [<<The Little Book That Beats the Market>>](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Still-Beats-Market/dp/0470624159) -  it requires careful design the experiment based on as much as possibly pre-collected data at your hand, welly and thourlghy analyzed , then took a reasonable guess, apply it via some trial and error. (ps: well, you just angle for first couple of times,  you might got the beginner's luck - you could laught at me - but hey bloke - your sample size is too small...)

In my case, the depth of the mountain side is like 5-6 meters deep from about 4-5 meters close to bank. It could even deeper farther way. On the other side , the shallow side, is like 2-3 meters deep from 4-5 meters - since I only do pole fish  and never use surf rod bebfore. I have no idea bout about what's depth of 20-30 - 50 meters away. Given what I know, it looks 3-8 meters depth could be a good ballkpark for winter from shallow side to try out first.



**Distance**

Along the previsouly mentioned old saying "The deeper the better", there is another corresponding old saying "The further the better" for casting. Conventional wisdom or those old sayings are good start point at first,  but never it shall be treated as something like doctrine. Those sayings are generally short , high condensed, and concise abstractions , well, at the sacrifice of leaving out full context and details of specific cases. They are best served as guidance(outward), and you need to dig it out by yourself(inward) - Turning outward guidances into intward experience. As Bruce Lee says in <<Enter the dragon>>：

>  "Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!"

If you're doing pole fishing, you know from probiliity perspective, the longer the rod and line, the higher chance you could catch big size fish. Why? because often the closer to bank, typically the shallower the water would be,  espec in day time, more noisy it would be - which is not a safe place for big fish(Carp is really smarter and more spooky than what you think they might be) to hide. Even so, veteran anglers still would cast out a couple of rods to test depth around the target fish spot -left,right, front or back -  to get a better idea about the lakebed terrain. This is very nature for pole fishing since it has marker floating and it is quite easy to test out the water depth from disntance of 2 meter - 10 meters. But for surf rod fishing it is little bit tricky, for it doesn't have a marker floating buit-in.  

It is not uncommon for some surf rod anglers just to rush to start fishing - cast out extremely long distance without much thought as soon as they arrived at the lake, and spend lots of time waiting on the bank, yet they didn't wanna just spend a few casts to test out the water depth and lake bed terrain of fish spot beforehand. They just go there, mount the hookbait and cast out whereever they want, then just wait like "I'm done with work on my side, it is the fish - your turn to bite".  Yes, they still coud get a bite from fish and caught it , no doubt.  But hmmm, lets take another proablbity game -  basetketball as exmaple , the goal of shooting  is to get basketball throught he hoop and score. Well think about it is the last shot - a possible buzzbeater,  there are two game plans from coache - one is Micachel Jordan or Kobe Byrant is taking the shot , if they got the cold hands(look : self-proclaimed GOAT [🐑](https://emojipedia.org/ewe/)Lebron James only got 8 points in the nba finals...) and it is highly possible for them to miss it; another is a nobody like me taking the shot, if I got the hot hand(every dog has its day), I might hit it.  But nonobyd would think I'm better than Micachel or Kobe, because they could do it consistently and with solid fundamentals of pyshican and mental - some of them is from hard-work training and desire to strieve for greatness and push theirself ot the limit . 

So just because it is a paobolity game full of randoms, it is aslo eactly why we need build our firmly well-sturcture reasonging from our experincen and observation during prepration(Cephas - lay the groundwork), setup open/continuous feedback loop during process(mieache jordan develop from early days altehic dunker -air jordan -  into an ellite fade-away jumper in his late years)，lower the expectation for the outcome - Let the chips fall where they may. And be aware of that temptation and emotion of yourself, try to know yourself better.

Then what's some fundentmtls here? cast out accuraccly . just pracice, you dont' need exact same spot,  some offset is perfectine fine - Remember it is not rock sicence.  For me, It didn't took me long to  be able to cast accurenty like 30 meter disnace with 1-3 meters radius in that vicinity.  I found it is extemly useful to record the moves of your casting in video. You could see your posture,movmenet and adjust accordingly - [The Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740) - what you think of yourself is probably not what you really are.

Casting out a couple of times  also help you get a great detail on the lakebed of fish spot  - is it gravel、rocky or weedy or silty ? Flat or sharp dropoff ?  How you gonna choose right rig strategy for it. Fish might get sacred and flee away by the sound of lead hitting the water surface, but some underwater video experiment shows those fish will slowly get back to search for the food. It is not a big deal in my case, as I have lots of time and patience for it while chilling cozily out at home with heating on and drinking my Longjing/Dragon Well tea - vibe 😎🤞 :)

I have chosen the distance like 20-30 meters far away from the bank. And 2.7 meters long rod with 5000 reel did a pretty good job considering the thickness of the fihsing line(line size 8). Since my focus is on fish's nocturnal behaviors, and night is quieter than day time, also based on what I know from above depth section, hence my assumption is that big fish will be morely likely to go to shallow water that close to bank where it could have more food to feed.


## BAIT/Feeder

blind-sided by commercial baits

Basically how could we attract the fish into the swim? Well, the fish use mostly following senses to detect and indentify whehter something is good to eat or not : smell、taste、sight. Fish have a pretty good olfactory system to sense any dissolved substance in the water ,and they could recognize the smell of  amino acids and others having nutritional value. It has showed that carp has thousands of chemoreceptors in their mouth on their barbels and even on the outside of their mouth and under their chin down to their neck. Chemoreception - They could taste, esp for carp, they sucks in a big mouth of silt and other detritus -  when they smell or feel via taste buds from their barbules, pectoral and pelvic fins of the eatable like bloodworm/corn etc - palatal taste organ in the mouth trap the food against the bottom of the mouth and expell non-food through gills(almost 90% got ejected). Also they have sensitive eyes, could see in lower light levels under the water and detetct changes in light and movement above the water - so camouflage like Rambo, anglers! However, their habit of feeding in the sediments on the bottom searching for small buried food items has required them to rely on highly developed senses of smell and taste.


Generally the feeding habit of carp is most fixed and stable like routine - eat what is plentiful - but sometime they will break it or at least try to discover new food sources. It is a dynamic process. Mostly stable-better chance, sometimes dynamic - slim chance. Consider that the reservoir which has lots of rice field/reed/mulberry tree around it, then most likely the rice/reed/mulbeery will get you better chance to get a bite consistently comparing to other food like corn that fish never see it before. On the other hand, if you prefeeding the same spot with lots of corn regularly over a long period of time, the feeding behavior of fish might change accordingly. The carp is not one-track minded, they're open to adapt their feeding habit if it works.

With those being said, it is always good to spend sometime beforehand looking at the surrounding of fishing location、talking to local angler to get a good idea about what kinda feeding/baiting feed are best for. Some anglers boast about the effectiveness of flavoured baits esp in those commercial videos - it is like the silver bullet for y'all. Touting how good the flavors or scents are with a vareity of chemicals as if it comes from some alchemist 、how pink color of boilies  performs better than yellow - `buy me you stupid angler,then you will be as wicked as me`. There are two common thought patterns:

* 1. If I feel good about it, then the fish must be feel the same like I feel, then the fish must feel good about too, hence go bite it.

* 2. It works for me for a couple of times, then it must work for you too.

The first one - induction - seems very strightforward , but with a short ponder,  shows it is flawed. The middle premise just couldn't stand. I saw lots of angler smell the bait, but come on, you need also taste the bait too, but no one did that :)  If the bait smells good, then they will think it could attract more fish than those which smells bad. Even though the way that those modlecurles trasmitting throught air is different from those tramsinting thought water, let alone different receptors betwen human being and fish, adding scents and flavors does attract the fish. but the question here is how to measure its effectiveness.`sola dosis facit venenum` - how much is approrate to be defined as a natural flvor and scent level for the fish. It has some range, isn't ?
Is it always "the more the better"? to how much it could just backfire?(Some Wu Wei wisdom from Livemore : Money is made by sitting, not trading)

Be be fair, those question are kinda difficult to find answers(or proably couldn't) and demand those "Charismatic leadership" 、 so-called carp fishing masters in the promoting videos from commerical fish tackle brands to put a disclaimer at the beginning - saying *"I'm not 100% sure about whether this fancy bait will work  - so you could buy this expensive one but it didn't work at all or even getting worse - and I just have no idea"*  - is kinda picky. But given human kinda are just natureally likes imitating as beginners, and nothging is more straightforwarnd、 intuitve and easier to reach  widely like videos , they're likly to copy what those teachter does , i.e. buy whatever tackles those masters are using and master's tackles and equiqments are damn pricy! They want to get their `hello world` running as soon as possible to get thrills, hey nobody is gonna read pages of document to get exact details of it - and I have no problem with that people are making money out of it.(Hey, I'not a contemporary cynicism and do like [franknesss from Adam Penning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLiArMvlfpg&ab_channel=CARPologyTVCarpFishing) among other carp fishing masters).



Either you dont' put up your effort and do your homework (expierment - retrospection/adjustment -expierment) and you pay with high price, or you pay with cheaper price, then put up your effort and do your homework. the second one in longer term is way more feasible/possible to have all planets aligned and hit the jackpot. Because those commerical baiting are just general abstractons by leaving out specfical details and contexts, you have to try different ones to try to match the context in your individual case: Up -> Bottom vs Bottom -> Up.

Still you can buy those branded ones, no problem , but just dont trap yourself into the mindset that you need to buy the most fancy and most expensive ones to get most bites. Fishing has a context, each is different. And context has so many factors, that baiting is just one of them and no one factor is over others by a crazy margin - if yes, then it only means it is just a snapshot. 

And that comes with the second thought pattern. They shows you the empirical success without talking about context or primary attributing factors - how carp fish uses their eyesight. Like in some video they says pink colored boilies is bettern than yellow ones and it is helping them catch more fishes - go get the pinks. But they leave out the stats like what time and what kinda of water condition in terms of visibiliy like full of sediments or clear one - those relates to the eyesight. Just because i have this empircal success, you 're gonna have the same success if you copy my fishing strategy - hmmmm?

To conclude, rice - from obeervation of rcie field ,  and feed corn (or maize) -  from local anglers,  is picked as candidates for the carp bait. Cleary I don't want wait for hours to get small nuisance fish bite , so the rice or pellets or small particles will be excluded. Since I'm gonna leave it under the water for 1-2 days, those bait shouldn't be easily dissovled or lose its liveness like live bait. So big solid particle like feed corn is a perfect fit and most important part is it is juuuust so cheap and so simple to prepare. Buy some feed corn, soak it and boil it, if you'd like - not necessary- could try experiment by adding some molasses or alcohols like Baileys or Tsingtao beer or hemp oil later.(Who knows! I have some Turmeric&Curry&Coriander&Garam masala powder left from last time trying cook indian food, and I might add those to test out)


After picked the bait for feeding, next thing is about the feeding strategy. Obiviously most reasonable one is to take little bit time to just chumming some baits to same spot every day(like one week or one month) before you really get your rods out and start fishing. But is is impossible for me as I only got 4-7 days holiday break and I really dont' want spend too much time on the bank to fish - I only got one hour break each day to go outdoors for fishing(family first) - that's exactly why I come up with an idea about auto carp fishing. To make it up, I decide to choose one fishing spot and bait there instead of moving around the lake on the bank. Here is my two cents on how to effectively attract fish in big nature water by feeding/baiting:

Basically we have the fish spot in the center, and feeding, i.e - corn- is evenly scattered around it forming a cricle with 3-5 meter radius. Loose chumming could possibly attract further fishes in a longer distance than precise baiting, as it could cover bigger and wider water area by its falvors and scents. Then we use pva bags or pva mesh to precisely bait right in the center this circle. Well this seems pretty ideal, the tricky part is how to get chumming like what hands can do but in a longer distance ? Slingshot、Spod、 pva bags/mesh、 gaint throwing sticks/baiting spoon even fishing bait boat couldn't do that easily.

In above picture and videos, that is a home-made spod with bottle and a lead. You could see that the corns inside the bottle will be detached from the lead/sinker benehter it as it is falling and is about to hit the water. Those dry corns has a lighter weigh comparing to the lead and will split out and be scattered into the water - inside a circle of 3-5 meters. The downside is the baiting inside it need to be light/dry and also it won't cast out very far away given its bad aerodynamic shape. But it fits my case - actually that's exactly my intention to not fish from a very long distance. Everything has its pros and cons, just like coding or system or archecture design, you need analyze the situation first to get a big picture,then weighs between different apporaches, prioritize and comes to a trade-off.


## Rigs 

A quick recap on the fish tackles : 2.7 meters long rod、5000 reel、braided line with size of 8 and 8 strands、a slim bobber float(just for testing depth)、80g~2.8oz sinker、 hair rig of big size 4 circle hook with pop-ups buoyant bait、smaller size 7 Izu Iseni hook for bottom bait with feed corn. To be honest, I have some doubt on using fake bait like plastic corn as bait.

Only middle part of China in Sichuan and Chongqing use similar fake bait, but not my hometown or province - like never. Most people here rarely use any kinda pop-ups bait or circle hook, instead they are inclined to use bottom bait with iseni hook for big-size fish. For people fishing with pole, they only use maximum two hooks for each. However for people fishing with rod and reel, they just use a fewww hooks - chinese way of understatement. Let's take a look at two most frequently used hook patterns:

 串钩 or 爆炸钩 图片
 ps1: I guess in us/uk it is called something like gang/party hooks? [(Christmas party in Downing Street while London was in strict lockdown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfTsLjdb3Mc&ab_channel=CNN) :) 
 ps2: update - later I found it is called sth like flapper or clipped down rig for sea fishing as it is illegal to have more 2 hooks for freshwater in uk?
 
The logic is pretty straightforward: more hooks more bites. Despite of the so-claimed moral superiority of using fewer hooks from some people - as long as it doesn't voilate the local regulations, I don't see any problem with that. On the flip side of more hooks is that it means hooks has higher chances getting trapped in snags or structure forms like rocks/reefs/weed when angler cast out or play the fish. If you use it in open water which has less snags and have a pretty good understanding on the condition of the lakebed, then go for it. But I have mountain reserovir with lots of snags like rocks and weed, plus a design of non-attended angling, so multi-hooks seems not a good option. Ideally one hook but as I said, I never use pop-up bait with fake corn before , so I want to do a experiment and compare it with common bottom bait with feed corn side by side. Even though techniquly fish is not `eating` the fake plastic corn but more like `chewing` - they just try out the possible food through their mouth and expell it out, I'm still very curious to just, by myself, to catch some fishes in order to test out popular saying:  "If I dont' eat plastics, how come fish will eat it ?"

Apart from adding more hooks to increase the odds, adding more rods could also get greater chance - 3 rods looks good (no matter how great your setup your rig and how fmailiar you're with the lakebed conditions, it could still happen that your lines and hooks got tangled when casting or got a bad presentation somehow when landing on the lakebed).

## Wrap-up

In this article we have covered the angling strategy that we're gonn ause for the carp fishing , tailed to the unique fishing scenario and non-attended fishing style. Those are the buildingblocks for next chapter, which we're gonna elaborate on device - how to setup the trigger, read whether got a bite from fish and call my cellphone to notify.





保证鱼不容脱钩发力

* 泄力 - 比如弹簧 或者橡皮筋 rubber band or fabric latex
* 铅坠 - 活动 - 这样鱼不会那么会摆动
* 缓冲 - 加多10米的线在岸上 冬天鱼的活力没那么好 metabolism
* open water, less snags or structure (rock formations/too much weedy)
