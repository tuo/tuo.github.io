Why do I want to quit coffee?

Well, for one, I've noticed that my sleep quality hasn't been great lately. I feel like coffee might be contributing to that.

I drink pretty much every day, one cup of instant coffee in the morning and another one at noon for maybe 10-12 years. Even though money is not that much, it adds up, it's not a small amount.

But lately, I've realized that every time I drink coffee, it doesn't give me the same feeling of freshness it used to. It's like I've lost that initial excitement about it. Sometimes, it feels no different than drinking water, and it's not even making me more alert or focused anymore. So, what's the point of continuing to drink it?

I decided to set a goal for myself: to change my coffee-drinking habit and eventually quit it altogether. I know it might be tough to completely stop right away, so I thought of starting with a short-term goal: going from having it every day to just once a week. That way, it doesn't feel too overwhelming, and I can gradually reduce my coffee intake.

 
 
## Quitting Journey

At the beginning, I started drinking coffee for the purpose of staying alert, as caffeine can accelerate heart rate and bring a sense of pleasure, making the brain more awake. However, when I began the first day of quitting coffee, I experienced feelings completely opposite to my initial encounter: it wasn't pain, anxiety and depression, but rather boredom and emptiness. I couldn't lift my spirits, and my brain was kinda foggy. I felt like a lifeless body, completely unable to concentrate. I looked up some information online and found out that these were typical addiction withdrawal symptoms during the early stages of quitting. 
 
After the second and third day, the discomfort had slightly eased, and the concentration got improved a bit. However, I almost couldn't resist the urge to drink coffee, so I opted for a cup of tea instead, which helped to alleviate the itchiness. Finally, the weekend arrived, and I couldn't wait any longer; I had a cup of coffee.That taste indeed brought back that freshness of the first time I drank coffee, and after finishing it, I could feel my heartbeat accelerate, my body and mind become invigorated.
 
In the following second and third weeks, the quitting process became relatively smooth. The craving for coffee was no longer as strong, and my attention gradually returned to the level before quitting. Overall, I started feeling more comfortable and at ease.

<cite> habit tracking calendar</cite>

 
When I began my coffee quitting journey, following online recommendations, I bought a calendar paper of habit tracker. If I successfully abstained from drinking coffee on a given day, I would solemnly mark a check on it with a pen. This simple ritual made me feel satisfied because each check represented accomplishing a small goal. (one step closer)
 

As time went by, about one or two months later, I no longer felt the need to drink coffee purely for its stimulating effects. However, I still maintained the habit of drinking it once a week, as completely giving it up would take away some pleasures. But now, I don't stick to a specific time for drinking; instead, I randomly choose a day within the week to drink. Additionally, I've been trying different styles of coffee such as latte, Americano, cappuccino, hot, and iced, to bring some novelty.  Well, I could still enjoy the freshness of coffee without indulging.

 
## Reflections on Quitting

During this process, I noticed the addictive aspect of coffee. It started with just having it occasionally, but slowly, I found myself needing it every day. As I continued with the same amount, the stimulating effects and pleasure gradually diminished. Drinking coffee just turned into a habitual behavior, and I felt subconsciously compelled to drink it. Not having it made me feel like something was missing, but drinking it didn't provide the same effect as before, and I even felt less alert. To keep up that effect as before, I need add up the amount of coffe intake. If I skipped one day, I would feel extremely low, bored, and a sense of emptiness, which would drive me to seek more coffee to alleviate those negative feelings.

This addiction felt similar to the gaming addiction I experienced during my student days, as well as the addictions some relatives and friends had to somking and alcohol. I became curious about how coffee affects the brain and body, so I looked into the mechanisms of addiction, and one word stood out: dopamine.

> Dopamine is known as the feel-good neurotransmitter—a chemical that ferries information between neurons. The brain releases it when we eat food that we crave or while we have sex - all those behaviors would lead to a higher chance of survior(complete to get more resources and higher chance to reproduce etc ), contributing to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction as part of the reward system. This important neurochemical boosts mood, motivation, and attention, and helps regulate movement, learning, and emotional responses.

<cite>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dopamine</cite>

High dopamine levels in the brain are associated with feelings of excitement, motivation, and even euphoria. On the other hand, low dopamine levels can lead to feelings of low mood, depressed.


![dopamidopamine_sine_curvene_sine.jpg](http://d2h13boa5ecwll.cloudfront.net/20230728quitcoffee/dopamine_sine_curve.jpg)

<cite>(A simple description is that dopamine fluctuates around its baseline level, oscillating between peak and valley values, much like a sine wave.)</cite>

 

Dopamine plays a crucial role in the reward system of our brain. As humans, our brains are hard-wired to seek out behaviors that release dopamine in our reward system. Dopamine is released when the brain is expecting a reward.

Just imagine the first time you eat some delicious food at a restaurant or experience other pleasurable stimuli like video games or intimacy. The moment you taste the food or engage in the activity, a flood of dopamine is released in your brain. It makes you feel high and possibly euphoric, which reinforces the desire to repeat that experience with the same stimulus - a cycle of motivation, reward, and reinforcement. So, while dopamine itself doesn't directly produce pleasure, it does strengthen the feelings of pleasure and reward associated with specific behaviors or substances.

Next time, when you think of the food you ate last time, you already start to feel high because of dopamine release, even with just mere anticipation.

![dopamine_activity_reward_expectation](http://d2h13boa5ecwll.cloudfront.net/20230728quitcoffee/dopamine_activity_reward_expectation.jpg)

<cite>Unexpected rewards increase the activity of dopamine neurons, acting as positive feedback signals for the brain regions associated with the preceding behavior. As learning takes place, the timing of activity will shift until it occurs upon the cue alone, with the expected reward having no additional effect. And should the expected reward not be received, dopamine activity drops, sending a negative feedback signal to the relevant parts of the brain, weakening the positive association. Source： [Dopamine, Smartphones & You: A battle for your time](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/)</cite>

When dopamine is released, it needs to activate dopamine receptors to generate an excitatory response in the brain. Once the receptor gets activated, dopamine gets recycled back to our body with the help of transporters. The dopaminergic system maintains a delicate and subtly dynamic balance. It is like a seesaw; when one end (pleasure) goes up, the other (pain) goes down. However, it slowly comes back to normal, just taking some time. The body will rebalance, and the baseline level will return to normal. That's the natural state of the dopaminergic system - dopamine is generated by the body and recycled by the body.

However, in this digital era, the stimuli have increased exponentially compared to what our ancestors experienced not that long ago, around 100 years ago. We now have access to TV, computers, and phones, and the internet has become dominant worldwide. Additionally, there are drugs and highly processed chemicals, such as sugars, that cannot be obtained from nature simply by chewing on coca plant leaves like Andean peoples did. These chemicals are highly purified and isolated from plants. They deceive and manipulate the dopaminergic system by either delaying recycling, prompting the body to release more dopamine, or increasing the level of activation on dopamine receptors.

![activity_dopamine](http://d2h13boa5ecwll.cloudfront.net/20230728quitcoffee/activity_dopamine.jpg)

Those are totally unseen before. Like Nietzsche says, 'God is dead.' Ever since then, those natural limits forced upon us to keep us in well-being are gone. The dopamine system was welcomed to a Brave New World. Now, you have so many choices, and of course, we'd like to give a try to Amusing Ourselves to Death. But why?

Those chemical stimuli lead to a very high dose of dopamine release (the peak is higher) compared to natural stimuli, so much so that anyone who tries those stimuli would immediately lose interest in the natural ones our ancestors had. However, you won't stay that happy forever; even though external chemicals can easily overpower the native 'inferior' and 'inefficient' primitive dopamine system, much like an elephant stamping on ants. The balance is broken, and the primitive dopamine system fights back by reducing the number of receptors or, in extreme cases, sacrificing some cells or organs to protect itself and try to regain balance. These protections could cause irreversible damage to the body. So, your dopamine baseline level also gets lifted up along with your peak dopamine levels.

Again, remember the pleasure you feel is equal to **peak - baseline level**. It make sense now that I take same amount of coffee everyday,but the pleasure I got is weaker and weaker, just like the law of diminishing returns in economics.


![drug_brain_damage](http://d2h13boa5ecwll.cloudfront.net/20230728quitcoffee/drug_brain_damage.png)

<cite>source: [How do drugs affect the brain?](https://www.farcanada.org/understanding-addiction/how-do-drugs-affect-the-brain/)</cite>


So they need get more chemical stimulus to keep same level of pleasure they feel. Quite ironically when dopmaine peak got higher for sometime, the dopamine baseline also adjusted itself to a higher level.

And just think about what if you pull out the stimulus inbetween? **peak - baseline level** will give you a negative number, aka, the pain, boredom and depression along with pyshical susfferings. Since previously the baseline level get so high, and so used to high dopmaine stimulus, they just can't stay satified with natural stimulus. Eating a delicius food would have zero interest on them, the little joyment from that is not even recogolizable for them. At this low dopmain level, the speed of the time passed by in psyhology feels slower, hene more painful you would feel, leading a negative reinforcement(Davis double-killing effect, ps anyone remember [the death spiral of stable coin Luna](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2023/08/02/this-startup-wants-to-fight-bladder-cancer-with-a-genetically-engineered-virus/?sh=2cdf924933b0) ?). It is easy to understand why they could fall back to relapse as it is most convenitnly way to get rid of that uncomfonrtablen feeling.

## Smartphone Addiction 

My commute routine: In the morning, after waking up, I first check my phone. Then, while riding my bike to the subway station on my way to work, I play videos in the background from platforms like Bilibili or YouTube to listen to.

During the subway ride, I use the time to learn Duolingo (Spanish in 5-minute units). After that, I watch short videos on various platforms like Tiktok, Bilibili, and YouTube Shorts. When I arrive at the office, I turn on my latop and do some warm-up activities (first checking V2ex, and YouTube) before getting into work mode. During work, I also occasionally check my phone, including when I go to the restroom. Sometimes, I do the same during lunch with my colleagues. On the subway ride home, feeling tired, I take out my phone and open short videos to learn about carp fishing.

Yeah, pretty much stick my face on the phone.

The problem is that I start feel I got into a negative cycle. Feel less enngezied and couldn't fcous and sth less patience on 2 year and half kids when he ask me to paly with him. One weekend when I take him out to kids area of a mall, I look around and relaize most of parents are just playing their phones - mjority of then are short videos apps.

This is alike blackhold just sucking in most parts of my life. I was lost and got trapped. 

It turns out for instnce, tiktok, those super-short clips are like heroin for our dopain systme just like above chemicals stimulus. Its algorithm is specifcally tailed to keep our dopaime level at a concerning high. Those random intermmited unexpected rewarding path got our brain tricked pretty much like hitting a jackpot , causing brain to release dopamine. We are lost in  endless, mindless scrolling because the brain are craving a new random video to get a new shot of dopamine.

Andrew Huberman nailed it:

> Addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. A good life is the progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure".

<cite>[(226) DOPAMINE DETOX: Take Back CONTROL Of Your Life & STOP LAZINESS! | Dr. Andrew Huberman - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLORsLlcT48&ab_channel=TomBilyeu)</cite>

Bertrand Russell once said well: “The secret of happiness is this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.” 

<cite>I dont' think I'm friendly to those stimulus that interest me. Certainly I won' ask them for permission, I just take it commandly :) Well Russell probably didn't know that things and persons that interest you is the devil who is playing a nice card. （打友情牌咋说？ 人畜无害牌？）</cite>

Comparing to learn or work, immeidate-gratification types activity could easily get us hooked. That's why it is so hard for me to get into working state. The beforhead immeidicat-grations types activity get my dopamine base level higher and at the same time, it exhaust me mentally and physically. Once the stimulus get pull out, the dopaline level drops, the sympton of dopamline depletion kicks in.
The focus is hard to gain and feel bored in front of the low-and-long-dopamin-reward tasks. So it is better to arrange tasks in a dopamine-scientific way. (BTW, anyone really do serioues learning on tiktok ? I did try to learn carp fishing but after a while it starts recommending videos of girls shaking their asses ? WTF, I neither do that type of search nor accidently click on one)

Another thing is that just don't stack dopmaine atcitivties. Don't multitask on high dopamine activities. Do it one by one as much as you can or mutiple but as natural as you can. When you eat, just eat, you dont' eat with playing your phone at the same time. You might think you can kill two birds with one stone, but actually you might kill 2 stones with one bird. You basically ruined two pleasure things at the same time. When Tired, Sleep. When Hungry, Eat.

> Someone asked a Zen Master, "How do you practice Zen?"
> The master said, "When you are hungry, eat; when you are tired, sleep."
> "Isn't that what everyone does anyway?"
> The master replied, "No, No. Most people entertains a thousand desires when they eat and scheme over a thousand plans when they sleep."

I'm so fed of this rat race. Sometime later, after I back from work, I try to put everything down and empty my mind, and play with my son. Well this time, on the commute of back from office, I don't play with phone. Instead I observe, look around people and what they're doing, close my eyes for minutes just to listen to the sounds of the train, that's it. When I play with him, I notice his expressions, reactions and we work togehter to build sth with some Lego blocks. Sometimes he is not paitent and will tear the building down immeidately. Sometimes he had some actions that out of box of adult's thinking in my opinon. It is so fun to watch. And maybe minutes later, he would play on his own and seems not very intersting on you.

It is definitely freshing experince and I feel deep connection between us. I wasn't eager for gain high dopamine release, but I do feel the peace and joyment in that moment of fully present.


What I decide to try in the following weeks: 

* When you eat, just eat.
* When you defecate, just defecate.
* Just drink water for a random day of the week, no tea, no coffee
* delete tiktok 
* half of time in the week dont' listen to anyting on commute 
* Half of the time on the metro, try take off my glasses (I'm nearsighted) and simply observe the surroundings with everything blurred.

## dipamine traps in buildin habit


### 1. visutalzie too much in the starting time of new habit

When we start building a new habit, we tend to think or vsiualize how greate we would be after the habit. Maybe you losing weight,quit somoking or do running, you cn't help to start visualize and project the better self after certain period of time. Oh I will drop my weight like 20Kg in 3 mohnths, run 10KM in 2 months etc. Just think it , as above menteioned, anticipation would cause oru brain to release high dose of dopamine to drive us to pursure it. This high dose of dopamine could boot risky-decision making, causing compulsive gambling etc to get max rewards as soon as it can. So in this case, it would lead us to set inappropriate goals for each step, overestimating in the short term. High dopamine level creates high motivation, but it won'
t last long if it can't be realized in real world. Maybe goal of first step is easy to get done, but how about the second one, thirid one? The actual reward often is less strong then the antifipation. That just give us a hard time to keep doing.

You need lower the expection upfront. Or after one week, start to do haibt planing. For instance, when I start learning Spanish in Duolingo, I set the goal to 5 minutes, the minimum in 10, 20,30 minutes. Even though the first time I finished with a breeze and I noticed that I have strong desire to do more units, but I keep one for the first day. Cause if you do more, it would burnt out your movitiation upfront in long term.

High expection would lures you to think you're on top of the world, but it is better to stick to yourlself being humble like a fool.

### 2. perfectionism in pursing streaks

In Duolingo, every day you finished a goal, you have this nice and attracting animiation to signal that you win. It just gives you a pleasing effect. Plus you could see the streaks on your calender. Look the line that cross all days on your calendar, that smooth line. That just let you feels good and you're likely to do it tmr.

Take a look a the check animation:

<img src="http://d2h13boa5ecwll.cloudfront.net/20230728quitcoffee/duolingo_checkmark.gif" style="zoom:50%;display:flex;"/>

And habit track calendar:

![duolingo_progress](http://d2h13boa5ecwll.cloudfront.net/20230728quitcoffee/duolingo_progress.jpg)

<cite>I have a streak of 998 days pretty like 1000 days at this time of writing. I can't imagine what would be it if I set my goal to 10 minutes or 30 minutes a day(I'm not sure they have so many units then).</cite>

I had a perfect streak, but there are few times that I almost miss one or two days. One day I thought I have finsihed a unit, but around 11:35 PM near the midnight, it sends notification that youre' gonna miss the streak. Then I came to notice I atuacally didn't do it.  So I rush to open the app and finish one unit.

The problem , along the time , that I have noticed with this beautify streak and cehck animiation - those things are supposed to and did provide one dip of movitation and pleasure to keep you in , now it puts some coginive burden on me. I'm more concerend to not break this perfect streak and nice anmiation rather than actually learn from each unit. In other words, I have became addicted to the form of haibt building auxiliary tools in this process. The real purpose, the origin vision is gradually fading out in those daily autopilot routine in pursuit of perfect formalities for sake of formalities.

The more creatvie and more dopamine-hit the animation etc those tools could provide, the more likely you would put yourself in those shackles. The pleasure and dopmaine you get from actual doing is probably less than the one you get from that goal-check and streak. This whole thing just total againist its own purpose, isn't it ? It will backfire!

##### Uncertainty 

As i gow odler, the more I know that uncertainty is probably submerged part of iceberg, the more I know I need shifting from a certainity mindset to uncertainty mindset. Life throws you a curveball. You really do have much control on your life as you think you have. And things don't work in lineary way,. there are ups and downs that's why it is fansinating.  and you have no much control on how low the downs is.

You're very likely to miss one step. It is a sure thing. I know I have been keeping the streak for almost 1000 days, but I don't konw someday this streak will defniitly get a break. I caught covid twice and also someday I just realy don't have the mood to do it esp some intimate friends or relatives got passed away, just being brain foggy all day and have no movitation to do it.

And that slip up will break the perfection of the streak as if you lost all the progress. It is a nail sticky inside your brian. So much so that in order to get rid of that negeative feelings and emotions of inperfect streak formality, you want to start it all over. 
It is so harsh that it often leads people down, even question themself. "You just can't do anything ! I told you", a voice from bottom of head, paying a tribute to the <<Notes from Underground>>.

That downward spiral is destroyful like Luna' crashing. The depletion of the dopmaine levels you build over time would cause you feel pain and bordem , even depression, to some extreme a ferocisu attack against one's self. As attack yourself is a quick way to get some relief.

Well you can go back to premvisou day and mark a check to make it look like a streak. But my friend, you can't lie to yourself. This is the worst thing I could imagine you doing: in order to get external satifsiaction, you cheat on your inside. This is gonna accerlate the time you giving up the habit, and even worse you did a serious damage to yourself.

"You're not only a quitter, also a liar, a liar to not somones esle, but to yourself. You desever every bad sthing you had in your life" , a voice insider your head.

Certaintiy mind defenitely paly a positive role and help us get there, until it hits a all. To be able explore ourselevers, we need to constantly peel the onion of ourservles of this fixed and habitiual thining. To not frame ourself in some comfound to get to much security and comfortablness, to not attach ourself to specifc style (like streaks), but focus more on the essences, on doing and eventualy on being. Lastly just be honstly with yourself. To express it with fully present and wholeheartely.

Perfectnism is numbe one enemy in building longterm habit. There isn't nothing wrong to pursue the perfectnism of styles and formalitiy, but let's not forgot the essences. Otherwise, it would be like Bruce Lee said in the <Enter the dragon>:

> It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

The perfectnism is so fragile in front of the force of uncertainty.


## Feel and Being


weh have a bit pickture how dopamin system and brian works. When dopmaine level reachs peaks, don't intentionlay introduce more unelss it is in a natural way and when dopamline level crash, also dont' intentionla seek stimulus to get rid of those uncormrable feeldings. Well, the key is how do you know it? how do you enven awware that of you're in that kinda state?  That's number one question.

This looks easy but it is very hard to do. Because knowing in a dopamine base level is quite idfferent from knowing in a high or low dopalimen level. The standard way of saying means it won't apply to each invidiual because each one is unique and different by itself. Therefore there is no stanard and concret anwser to this. However, we could start by delierately building our awareness. An awareness reuqires openness, one must fully acktnotelyge  their ignorenace,  emptying their cup. Whhich will naturally leas to a curisoty to oneself inwards as authentic existing in this cosomos. Aware your body ,emitaion, thoughts and surroundinsg.

TnUmber two: how can we deal with that state and feelings. Awareness is kidna letting it go, obesver at a dstaince. Feel the body, the emomtional and all  those wandering thoughts before instinctily react to those. experience the moment, be fully present. Those bordem and pain are interesting to watch, isint'? just like when we go outside like park, someimties my son  stop on the trail and he could watch the ants moving here and there with that focus , curisoity and paitenice in his face.

We have lost thos subtle senstivity for quite long time: ssentivy of body, ssenseity of surroundsing. Those illusive feeling of "secuure" and "comfotable" taht we build over years of habitual activites leas us to belive we have hold the utilmate authority, until life thorws again you another curveball. We are getting rigid and more like the rat in the rate race, losing all those colorful, dynamic individual temperament that every authentic,honst and unique human being posse from their born - The light inside is off, left with a ultimate darkness.

Be open to the uncorfortableness, hold your immediate desire to place your judgement, feel and expeirence it as it is a precious gift.

Then uncorfortableness (pain/bordeom just like dopaimine depletion) is a greate hint to  break the our rigid thinking developed through our daily routine. We're no longer autopiloting, seriouesly you need step back and check, which is acutally a good thing. As Bruce Lee put it nicely in 1970 when he hurt this back very badly that possible leads to paralyze, in his letter to his friend:

> “But with every adversity comes a blessing because a shock acts as a reminder to oneself that we must not get stale in routine.” It’s not the situation that’s the problem. It’s how you react to it.

<cite>source: [Bruce Lee Podcst: #11 Walk On](https://brucelee.com/podcast-blog/2016/9/21/11-walk-on)</cite>

German mystical Meister Eckhart once said:

> Truly, it is in darkness that one finds the light, so when we are in sorrow, then this light is nearest of all to us.

Losing streak maybe is reminder for us to examine it: do we diviate from the essence? what efforts should I put on? Should I change direction little bit ?

There is another question merged from this: doing is imporant, and you need take action on your reflection, but is it enogh? I kinda remember Martin Luther when in The Reformation, in this book <Treaites on good work> , he explains that salvation and faith are not earned by good works, but that good works flow from salvation and faith. You dont' do the good work just for the sake of the reward from God. And in this <Preface to Romans> he saids:

> The person with a true faith will perform the works of the law because the works of the law will be what they desire to do; the works are thus an outworking and a result of the faith, in the same way that heat is an outworking and a result of the fire.

That's actually quite inpsiring for life thought. You shoudl think you should be, not what you need to be. Doing is just natuarl extension of Being, it got spillove and radiated from the Being just like The One of Plotinus(remind me of Trickle-down economics).

Let's say a person try to build ahbit to lose 10kg in 2 months. He think he need to lose weight and do it by exeercise and eat less. The easily see reason of oveweright is eating too much and exercise too little. But that could just be the tip of the icerberge. There could be deep reason behind this. Maybe he has a stressing family or toxic working envoriment, then he has no outlet for thos negative emoations and choose over eating as a way of relesing that pressure? You can just blame them for that. You can face the anxiety of yourself, and accept it and come up with actions (either move out this enviroment or sth elese. Then from the root leve, you mightn not chooose overeat to handle the stress anymore. And eating and execise to a  more health way as a habit would natuarally happens. And whether losing weight 10Kg in 2 months doens't matter that more. 

Building habits is great way to gain better understanging on oneself. Knowing oneself is constant process and it is very hard. Do a deep dive into your inner world that nobody else could do is damn tough and even daunting. God is dead, and you're the light to yourself. You will feel alone here and there but never you would feel lonely - the deep connection across time and space from human beings  bond us togher. Walk on!
