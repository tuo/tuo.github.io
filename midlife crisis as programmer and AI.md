# midlife crisis as programmer and AI

#### intro:

midlifecrisis 定义： 年龄35-45，上游老下有小，看似稳定的生活包括然后收入可能随时被打破，但是一些年形成的自我良好的变成了思维定义，失去了某种对于生活的激情。社会上主流的Prescribed timetable and social nuns, and expectations 像钳子一样，给你打来安全感同时某种程度我们失去了自我反思反问。

在我的场景：35马上36岁，程序员在中国可能是一个尴尬的年龄，并没有光鲜的履历。没待过大厂，是比较容易收到冲击的，特别是疫情之后的全球的经济形势，特别是自从2023年。

还有一件事便是AI的发力，2023年的Chatgpt大语言模型的兴起，从某种程度上冲击了很多职业，当然程序员也是其中之一。

这些都使得人处于一种比较焦虑的心态之中。



## Myself tech background(Real intro)

Just any ordinal programmer, I studied Software Engierneering major in university. After graduate from university at 2010,  I worked almost two years in Thoughtworks as agile consultant -mostly ruby on rails web development and scrum agile stuff. Then I thought mobile devleoper is kinda cool and why not a give shot? Joined a small mobile development team at ReignDesign, focus on iOS development, some android though. 5 years later, the company moved to chile and I joined a current company to take role as Tech Leader, kinda like full tech (web/backend/infra) and what's interested me is that I want to know how to shift from developer/coder to different role that involve manage not self but whole project and people as whole.

If I say I'm a really really good and top developer, that would be bragging; If I said I'm not good developer, I would be lying and not be honest. 

Every transition went on good for me as I'm quick learner and keep adjusting and still have a passion for tech and coding. Not to say I'm that eager learner like that "Seven language in seven weeks" ,  but it is natural for me to browse some new techs and just play with it.

In 2021, back when the FED is printing tis money and every tech copmany looked like expanding and hiring, I got reached by some companies. The first one is Facebook London, and the coding is horriable. I haven't taken any serious interviews for a long time before that and barely know how the current tech interview process looks like.  The first time it failed and gave me a shock. Then I sit back and quickly gather around my head , did some search and take a full review on the tech interview process and work up from basics for leetcode and system design. Behaviorial  is never a problem for me. In about around four weeks, I praticed hard on algorithms and designs  in my spare time,  and surpisingly refreshed some expierence I had in real-world and learned something now. Then tried with Booking, and it didn't go every smooth. But I grow my expiercen , then later nailed two offers from CloudKitchen and Flexport. CloudKitchen is pretty cool, but kinda mysterious and the vesting plan hmmm.  Flexport wasno't that attractive. I guess tech company need just spend those money out to get more money, and the payment is good. Well, in the end, given my family reasons and I wasn't really looking for jobs initially, so I turned down those offers. When facebook reached second time, I told them that I was't intersted.  So I stayed in my curent company.

What goes up must come down. At the end of 2022 and 2023, the global economy is keeping slow down.  The big 4 tech is doing massive layoff.  Not just tech ,other industries also have start to cut their spending. And it hits China too.  Once fulled LinkedIn message inbox also is almost empty. What's even worse is that the clients of current company has lower or even complete remove the budget.  

I'm 35 and turn into 36 now. The reason about 35 being sesntive age in China is that if you wanna work for gov to take stable job, you need take civil service examination which has some age limit of 35 even though not on paper. So that door is closed. In the a developing country,the social is changing pretty fast and there are plenty of young people coming out college every year since the opening entyr of colleage in 2000. The unemployment rate of young people is pretty high. In fact most big tech companies,  intersnity of work is so high and there is 996 work culture which employees often work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, much like Japan's 80s. There is widely consus of 35 crisis for programmer, you could see lots of posts on this topic about aniexty and confusions in the popular Chinese programmer forum: ([site:v2ex.com/t 35岁 - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:v2ex.com/t 35岁#ip=1)).  Someones can't help says: "is food delivery and  ride-sharing  is the final job of 程序员的最终归属是外卖？滴滴" [大龄程序员的出路难道是开滴滴送外卖吗 - V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com/t/1002227)

Yep, that's what I'm facing. I might lose my current job in a short time and not gonna find another job soon. All that years that built with kinda good feeling of "I'm a good programmer, and everyting under control" now it is like a blowing ballnoon who get  bigger and bigger, sunddely  got pierced and that sound is so big that leave your head buzzing.  A curve ball thrown by life, and those senses of comfort, safety and secruity dissoves in a blink of eye.

That really hurts. 

## The cure

There is a ruler from socialtiy and us that could measure our outside masterial success. Those metric are visible and we're used to measure ourself by it since we grow up.  We want to go higher in that rank(You know the rat race?), so we could feel safer and better. That's subcconusoly becomaes part of ego and we dientify ourself with it. 

(图片Ruler)

Now by this ruler, I'm sliding to bottom part of, fearing of being elimited by KPI。That part of ego and identitiy starts working aginst me it triggers a chain of negativity, connected with deeply some worst memories and emotions in my life, leads to a serisouly self-doubiting as it desperately try to get out this bottom part as soon as possible.

That self doubt has put me to review my whole life. 

I start to ask "Who am I? Did I really love what I do ?"  Along recents years, i have some of best and deeply connected fmaily relatives passed away,  they passed away suddenly and fastly, that I thought or expected  they are gonna be there forever, and now suddenly gone. 人生无常， that leavs your in pondering "how fragile is life and how small/tingy human is". Hence I want to see through that outside ruler, material, scoails nuns, strip out those superficials, in the raw form, "who am I " and "What I really love to do".  That love is not to meet other people's expection, not for vanity, not for fame, not for money, not for fame, not to compare. None of it, but I have a intuituion/hunch that the answer must lies, not in the outward, but in the question itself.

//orign of life, 这样引出我对小孩的玩的观察。

I'm bothered. Life goes on. I have a almost three-years-old kid. My wife and I live away from our hometown of both, and rent some house here and we, as what we called in china, has another role  " teammates"  to take care of our kid. My kid just like to stick to his mom always.  When my teamate need do some her own things, like taking shower or go out shopping, I need ensure I could look after the kid without crying out for mom :)  That's a hell challenge, I need to distract him but watching this favoirte Pepper Pig, Bamboo Club or dinosaurs wont' last long, I have to actively engate with him through activities.Sometimes I take him to kids park（儿童游乐场） or park, sometimes just play with toys and do sth handle pencild drawings at home. 

It is one oridinary playing, my son sitting there to  playing with his 积木, and I'm lying aside and just wathcing him play. I could see he is fully engaged in the playing, his genius and dedicate expression in his face as if time has freezed and the world around him vanished. I feel sth (affections) just draws me and resonate sth once familliar and deeply inside me -  the serenitigy and joyment.  That heals and in that space and timepirod, I was free from all kinds anxiies, fear nor  happniess, any desires.  I dont' want to sounds  conry like revelations like any religon's mystistics like MatinLuther's thunder nor Pascal's near death on one ride, but it just like there is a glowing at his background. That glowing just wakes up my inner child and empowered me.

//basket or fishing

It reminds me of those similar sparks I had during playing basketball and fishing. In some intensive situations, I found that I was able to dropped out my preconceoinved my best moves to attack my opponent. In a blink of eye, my mind looks like hasn't got a chance to spin up and plot some plans,  it is a natual and instinct moves just coming out me. That move is totaly unexpected yet smooth. The oppnonet is like a dancer copmanision. we dont' figiht agianst each other, isntead we dance togother. There is not “me”  in this picutre, the hook, and oponent and my body  are just harmousoly blend as one. That is a amazing, wonderful, indescribable experience.

I notice that my son is playing without fear of being judged by what final result should be, without instilled with how it should be played, not to meet somenoes' expxectation or approval,  not to follow social  nuns, above those dulity of good/bad and past and future. 

sth that we could all related, but that's who we were in child time.  Kid knows how to play, they're born with gift to just play, to explore, to discover.  

maybwe think they haven't devleop high level consicuosu , hence only with subsoncious and aninmal spritit,  but man concious have gone too far and burden me so much as I grows, it just overwhlem all others. I forgot that play is just simply for sake of play.

There are three takeways from this observation:

* blank paper or empty cup mindset: to play is to leave behind the impressiosions or preconceived idealogities, to engage to play to disover to explore.
* switch play smoothly:  when the play doesn't seems fun to him, he git-stashes it and switch to new play naturally. No baggage or burden of previous play are carried to next play. Single tasking, not multi-tasking.
* Playing is a nature state of being:  not to please or ask for benefits or escape from the punishments. Pure and unfiltered state of being.



### Expierement

In the beginning, I really want to get rid of that anaxity and self-dbouting but soon I found myself in apostion of choinceless. I can't do anytihng about it. That has made me to slow down involuntarily. Anyone could feel that slow motion of time when involeved in negative emotions. With above playing experince from my son, I start to build the awareness - that is trying to apply that in the differnt aspects of my life through experiments. Quite to the oppose of scentific side, I check my critic, logic analysis and discursive thinking at the door, try to connect again with once-swpet-under-thecarpet 's child innocence, hence to explore and discover like a child. I'm not meant to be an anti-intellectual. When driving and wating at the crossroad for green light, you can't say, " hey , red is not red, green is not green so let's go", then it would not only hurt you but also hurt others.  However it would be perfect and suitable for me to walk in the park and look at the green leafs and red flowers,  and do an experiement of dropping that "red is red, green is green" judgetment or concept or categorization, just  see the things behind its names and labels, feel its essences in a direct way. It is at your disposal, at anytime you could stop and revert.

One of that expieemnt is also about trying to distract my sons' attenion from my wife. I saw a couple of times when he had a pen and he just freely draw himself. I thought why not doing basic idiotproof hand pencil drawing togather.  Well quickly I could hear a voice inside my head, whisperring "Screw you, just recall, through you life, you have no aesthetic cells at all, no taste. Come on,you're a programmer, not a designer, you are just good at playing 01. You dont' that have crazy hairstyle or unique lookings. No artistic temperament. Don't be childish".  Yeah, but this time I thought "Fuck you", whatsoever, I hang those in my clothing stand  and I give a shot. We start drawing with his favorite animales. Sometimes, he would collect different leaves of trees to show to his mom, later we would sit togher and just oberve the texture and the lines and sahpes of those leaves and draw it on the paper.

It is a intersting expeirence - two human being are playing and sharing and connecting. There is an echo back and forth. 

Those drawings by any academic standards or socaliy standards, wouldn't be considered art. But I feel it is the art, as for me art is about epxressing oneself honstly and be authetical showing what he sees and feels with his heart. Art is not fxied or limted to some labels or titles or jobs， it is limitless and it is everywhere in everybody.



## creativtiy

As I build up those expeirements, one thing starts to emerge and keep hitting on me.  That's when I do one activity, e.g Active A, and I bump into a wall, sth like writer's block, where you feel you have nothing to say about and feel how to move on.  You're kinda in a mess and feel no insiprations. 

Instead of forcing it with my will the hard way, to keep banging at the wall, I notice life leads you to next thing with smooth transition.  It is when you got stuck, maybe the sun is good outside, so you go out take a walk; maybe it is raining, weird enough that you want to feel how subtle the rain dropped on your face like what every child would do at the first time;  maybe it is lunch time, you go out to grab some food; maybe your kids just invite you to play and you play; maybe your friend ask you out; maybe you are sitting to long and your body remind you to get some exercise like fishing or play basketball or jogging.  I know it sounds conry、cliche and very subjective like a faith healer. Yep, I feel It always offers something or activities of different parts of life  for you to move on to.

I stash those things about ActivityA, and go fully blankslately into what comes next. Later when I came back to ActivittyA,  to my surprise, most of time, I just have some different perspectives or views. It wont' directly solve my problem at hand, or guareetend to bring inspirations, but I found it is interesting to play with differents ideas, and usally it brings new dimensions that I never got into before and just free to explore.

It seems the nature is sorting through those raw unfiltered gathered informations in the background without our knowing. It merged those new with our existings one like an alchemist.  It just connect with different dots, different aspect of life, just a childis drawing and exploring, no limit, no spefic form. All I need to do is : "Trust the Process" .

But sometimes I think:  "How you do know it? How sure you are? What's your proof" ?

I just feel it. For me, it is some beyond the conviction, faith, beilife. I'm giving it all and just aligning and flowing with it, no expectations or attachments. 

I do my part of keep my window open like settting up my antenna to pick any sginals that nature is sending to me, combined with my expeirence, I collect those unfilter informations and send it back. Nature is doing his part of orgnatizing and comes up with sth new.  It is a tacit agreement. It is a comaradeship.

The abliity to connect different parts, sth seemingly unrelated on the surface. it is the nature who has greatest and most primordial source of creativity .



图片Life and idfefent aspect of life

I could get in touch with in in the lens of  expericence of those diverse aspect of the life. The gems are scattered  in the most mundane of our daily life. 

Many artistists claimed that they have or had experice using drugs as a source of inspriations and creacitivyt, even the biggest one. Well, here is I thought: when you are in state of  craving:  "it feels good, I need more; I have a compact timestable, I need get it done i beforexxx, so just give it to more; I need sold 2 millions copys; I need it to get into top 100 of billboard; this one is good, I need make next one more impressive" and try force upon your will on that,  it literally just closed all windows for themeselves and pushed the that connection away. They will take shortcut, esp in easily accessabile enviroment, to use drugs to desperately throw themself into that delusion, hoping to get what they fancy about.  Eventually the cheat has to pay its toll. Not only losing the sobriety , also damamgint their body and brain in inreversible way, most importantly,it breaks the tacit agreements,  they could have lost the connection via other ordinaly life experices. The relap is boudn to happen, the dead end is front of them.

The inner boundary and inner compass is sth I have been handled over by nature, after delve into my inner world and aligin with that nature and reality.  It gives me freedom but also there is a boundary. However the boundary is setup voluterenyly and spontainteyly, not out of my personal desire or wills, nor out of society rules. I'm not saying to explore the flaws of laws, like what Wall Streets and Crypto world (only exception - Bitcoin) does, but the laws and the moral code of public may get stale, rigid and out of date, the one's inner one is always flowing and up to date.

It is clear to me, that based on who I am, drugs i sth that I would never take.

## To connect others via connecting yourself

To clarify: the things we refer to above like the essential truth or fundamental principles  or objective realtity or natural or alchemist, whatever you name it and label it, all points to something behind it.

The things behind is something coudn't put into words. You can intepret it as an intuition of  "Oneness", "Void", "Emptyness", "Unity" or "Substance". But those would limit it, as if it is only related to religion.  It is above human language yet not isolated from our daily life. No complicted jargons or fancy spritual words need put here. Anyone or anythign could look up to the sky right above them could get it. So the word "universe" is more common and relatable for anyone regardless of its background/ethitiy/color/nationlitiy, and will be used in following part of this article as reference to that inexpressable、indecrible, incomprehnsible, infitely thing not by its literal meaning in science.



THere is an ineresting story from Chuanz tz庄子, 530BC in China。庄子·逍遥游

> 而独不闻之寥寥乎？山林之畏隹，大木百围之窍穴，似鼻、似口、似耳、似枅、似圈、似臼，似窪者，似污者；激者、謞者、叱者、吸者、叫者、譹者、宎者、咬者；前者唱于，而随者唱喁；泠风则小和，飘风则大和；厉风济则众窍为虚；

It says: There are thousands of thousands of holes in the mountains with different shapes. Some look like a nose, some look like a mouth, some look like an ear, with different internal structures. When the wind is blowing on the earth, either small or strong, those holes generate different sounds, each with a unique pitch and tone. In whole, it is as if nature is conducting a symphony or orchestra. How harmonious it is!

图片 

Each hole has different internal structure, some may looks messy, some may looks perfect, but when each hole is self-asserting itself, each is contributing its one into that grand melody. Thought different and diverse, each has its root in that shared harmony from universe. Those individuals are somehow connected in their deepest level. When each is expressing, they dont' have specfic aim for harmony, that's never part of their initial drives, it is all about themseves. 

Suprisingly, when one is express his seeing and feeling about universe in his unfilterd lens in his own way, the universe seems could better connect to the deeply side of others. To awake the true authentica side of someone, to let him could make his own sounds,  no-pretenius, no-duplicating. Hence connect as whole and feel that flowing of the harmony.

Dont seek to copy what someoens does, seek what they're seeking, what they are after.  Don't concentrate on the finger, instead on what it is pointing to - the moon, the universe, the harmony,the one posses greatest source of creativy, inspriation, beauty and compassion.



## Back on crisis

The middle life crisis, if I don't identify myself with it, If I just leave the ego part aside, could be an oppuninty. That the overwall evironemnt is not friendly in tech market, you need provide steady bread on the table, your energy and body condition is decliiing, those are the reality with no denial. There are some implications : what if career is not about some fixed path, waht if the finanace is not about linear progression, what if body conditionling is decline but is getting more efficeint at the same time?

Life awalys providers you something new. And those are great times  to challenge some long-hold ideas or assumptions or impressions. To peel off the ego, artificallity and prentence, to go on a drect face-to-face conversaction with the naked self. It is just a play in a different form.

Anyone who try and pratice basic punch, would understand that instead of just focusing on use fist or hand and being rigid,   it is actually a flow and sequnce of invovelment of pretty much whole body.  The power starts with legs from the groud, then the hips and core, back and shoulder then to your arm and fist. That different msucles engates and do its own work, they know when to be flexible and when to be focus, and as a result, it provice maximam pwoer with efficient body mechanic. The body seems to know how to corrdinate and express it in tis nature way as one whole of indispensable and indivisible.





I'm not suay ing you shouldn't do planingk but thatplain tis requipresiuite is to living fully present moment,that is lived living not lived dying.  ANd not be attached to the outcome of the planning, not to idneityf oneself with it. As it is so easdier for us to get into tunner vission therefore lost the grande vision full.
