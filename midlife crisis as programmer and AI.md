# midlife crisis as programmer and AI

#### intro:

midlifecrisis 定义： 年龄35-45，上游老下有小，看似稳定的生活包括然后收入可能随时被打破，但是一些年形成的自我良好的变成了思维定义，失去了某种对于生活的激情。社会上主流的Prescribed timetable and social nuns, and expectations 像钳子一样，给你打来安全感同时某种程度我们失去了自我反思反问。

在我的场景：35马上36岁，程序员在中国可能是一个尴尬的年龄，并没有光鲜的履历。没待过大厂，是比较容易收到冲击的，特别是疫情之后的全球的经济形势，特别是自从2023年。

还有一件事便是AI的发力，2023年的Chatgpt大语言模型的兴起，从某种程度上冲击了很多职业，当然程序员也是其中之一。

这些都使得人处于一种比较焦虑的心态之中。



## Myself tech background(Real intro)

Just any ordinal programmer, I studied Software Engierneering major in university. After graduate from university at 2010,  I worked almost two years in Thoughtworks as agile consultant -mostly ruby on rails web development and scrum agile stuff. Then I thought mobile devleoper is kinda cool and why not a give shot? Joined a small mobile development team at ReignDesign, focus on iOS development, some android though. 5 years later, the company moved to chile and I joined a current company to take role as Tech Leader, kinda like full tech (web/backend/infra) and what's interested me is that I want to know how to shift from developer/coder to different role that involve manage not self but whole project and people as whole.

If I say I'm a really good and top-level developer, that would be bragging; If I said I'm not good developer, I would be lying and not be honest. 

Every transition went well for me as I'm quick learner and keep adjusting and still have a passion for tech and coding. Not to say I'm that eager learner like that "Seven language in seven weeks" ,  but it is part of my daily route to learn some new techs and just play with it.

In 2021, back when the FED is printing tis money and every tech copmany looked like expanding and hiring, I got reached by some companies. The first one is Facebook London, and I did the the coding part of interview horriably. I haven't taken any serious interviews for a long time before that and barely know how the current tech interview process looks like. That  time when it failed really gave me a shock. Then I sit back and quickly gather around my head , then did some research and take a full review on the tech interview process, work on the basics for leetcode and system design. Behaviorial  is never a problem for me since I guess maybe I awalays speak what's true about me. In about  four weeks, I praticed hard on algorithms and designs  in my spare time,  and surpisingly refreshed my knowledge I had at real-world trench and somehow learned something new. 

The second time I tried with Booking.com, and it didn't go well neither.  But I get more familiar and grow my expiercen , later I nailed two offers from CloudKitchen and Flexport. CloudKitchen is pretty cool, but kinda mysterious and the vesting plan hmmm.  Flexport wasno't that attractive. I guess tech company need just spend those money out to get more money, and the payment is good. Well, in the end, given my family reasons and I wasn't really looking for jobs initially, so I turned down those offers. When facebook reached second time, I told them that I was't intersted.  I stayed in my curent company.

What goes up must come down. At the end of 2022 and 2023, the global economy is keeping slow down.  The big 4 tech is doing massive layoff.  Not just tech ,other industries also have start to cut their spending. And it hits China too.  Once fulled LinkedIn message inbox now is almost empty. What's even worse is that the clients of current company has lower or even complete remove the budget.  

I'm 35 and am turning into 36. The reason about 35 being a sensitive number of age in China is that if you wanna work for gov to take stable job, you need take civil service examination which has some age limit of 35 even though not on paper. So that door is closed. In the a developing country,the social is changing pretty fast and there are plenty of young people coming out college every year since the opening entyr of colleage in the early 2000s. The unemployment rate of young people is pretty high. In fact most big tech companies,  intersnity of work is so high and there is 996 work culture which employees often work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, much like Japan's 80s. There is widely consus of 35 crisis for programmer, you could see lots of posts on this topic about aniexty and confusions in the popular Chinese programmer forum: ([site:v2ex.com/t 35岁 - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:v2ex.com/t 35岁#ip=1)).  Someones can't help says: "is food delivery and  ride-sharing  is the final job of eldlerly programmer ?程序员的最终归属是外卖？滴滴" [大龄程序员的出路难道是开滴滴送外卖吗 - V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com/t/1002227). 

With the emerging techuqniues of AI like ChatGPT, some coding could even be done by the AI. Are programmers gonna be replaced by AI ?

Yep, that's what I'm facing. I might lose my current job in a short time and not gonna find another job soon. All that years that built with kinda good feeling of "I'm a good programmer, and everyting under control" now it is like a blowing ballnoon who get  bigger and bigger, sunddely  got pierced and that sound is so big that leave your head buzzing.  A curve ball thrown by life, and those senses of comfort, safety and secruity dissoves in a blink of eye.

Damn, that really hurts. 

## observation from kid playing

There is a ruler from socialtiy and us that could measure our outward material success. Those metric are visible and we're used to measure ourself by it since we grow up.  We want to go higher in that rank, so we could feel safer and better. That's subcconusoly becomaes part of ego and we dientify ourself with it. 

(图片Ruler)什么图片来着？忘了

Now by this ruler, I'm sliding to bottom part of, fearing of being elimited by KPI。That part of ego and identitiy starts working aganist me it triggers a chain of negativity, connected with deeply some worst memories and emotions from the past, leads to a serisouly self-doubiting.  I could feel that urge to  desperately try to get out this bottom part as soon as possible.

That self doubt has put me to review my whole life. 

I start to ask "Who am I? Did I really love what I do ?"  Along recents years, i have some of best and deeply connected fmaily relatives passed away,  they passed away abruptly,  that I thought or expected  they are gonna be there forever, and now suddenly gone. 人生无常， that leavs your in pondering "how fragile is life and how small/tingy human is". Hence I want to see through that outside ruler, material, scoails nuns, strip out those superficials, put aside those labels like "practicality",  in the raw form, "who am I " and "What I really love to do".  Obvisoully that is not about meet other people's expection, not for vanity, not for fame, not for money, not for fame, not to compare. None of it, but I have a intuituion/hunch that the answer must lies, not in the outward, but in the question itself - aka inward.

//orign of life, 这样引出我对小孩的玩的观察。

I'm bothered. Life goes on. I have a almost three-years-old kid. My wife and I live away from our hometown of both, and rent some house here and we, as what we called in china, has another role  " teammates/commrades"   in terms of taking care of our kid. My kid just like to stick to his mom all the time.  When my teamate need do some her own space, like taking shower or go out shopping, I need ensure I could look after the kid without leave him crying out for mom :)  That's a hell challenge, I need to distract him but watching this favoirte Pepper Pig, Bamboo Club or dinosaurs wont' last long, I have to actively engate with him through activities.Sometimes I take him to kids park（儿童游乐场） or park, sometimes just play with toys and do sth handle pencild drawings at home. 

图片 瑾 河边风筝 还有玩 做饺子 和 游乐场

It is one of the oridinary playing, my son sitting there to  playing with his 积木, and I'm lying aside and just wathcing him play. I could see he is fully engaged in the playing, his genius and dedicate expression in his face as if time has freezed and the world around him vanished. I feel sth (affections) just draws me and resonate sth once familliar and deeply inside me -  the serenitiy and joyment.  That heals and in that space and timepirod, I was free from all kinds anxiies, fear nor  happniess, any desires.  I dont' want to sounds  conry like revelations like any religon's mystistics like MatinLuther's thunder nor Pascal's near death on one ride, but it just like there is a glowing at his background.  That Aha moment awakes something inside me , seomthing I already possessed but keep looking for from outside.

//basket or fishing 图片

It reminds me of those similar sparks I had during playing basketball and fishing. In some intensive situations, I found that if I was able to dropped out my preplans of my best moves to attack my opponents,  in a blink of eye, my mind looks like hasn't got a chance to spin up and plot some plans,  it is a natual and instinct moves just coming out me. That move is totaly unexpected yet smooth. The oppnonet is like a dancer companion. we dont' figiht aganist each other, instead we dance togother. There is not a “me”  in this picutre, the hook, and oponent and myself  are just harmousoly blend as one.  I'm so concentrated like my kid is playing, somehow the line that dividing and differenicating people and objects seems to dissolve. I could remember I keep recalling that indescribable experience all the time.

I also notice that when my son is playing, he is free from the fear of being judged by what final result should be, the rules  instilled with how it should be played, not to meet somenoes' expxectation or approval,  not to follow social  nuns, above those dulity of good/bad and past and future.  That 's sth that we could all related, but that's who we were in child time.  Kid knows how to play, they're born with gift to just play, to explore, to discover.  

maybwe think they haven't devleop high level consicuosu , hence only with subsoncious and aninmal spritit,  but man concious have gone too far and burden me so much as I grows, it just overwhlem all others. I forgot that play is just simply for sake of play.

There are three takeways from this observation:

* blank paper or empty cup mindset: to play is to leave behind the impressiosions or preconceived idealogities, to engage to play to disover to explore.
* switch play smoothly:  when the play doesn't seems fun to him, he git-stashes it and switch to new play naturally. No baggage or burden of previous play are carried to next play. Single tasking, not multi-tasking.
* Playing is a nature state of being:  not to please or ask for benefits or escape from the punishments. Pure and unfiltered state of being.



### My Experiement

In the beginning, I really want to get rid of that anaxity and self-dbouting but soon I found myself in apostion of choinceless. I can't do anytihng about it. That has made me to slow down involuntarily. Anyone could feel that slow motion of time when involeved in negative emotions. With above playing experince from my son, I start to play with the awareness - that is trying to apply that in the differnt aspects of my life through experiments. Quite to the oppose of scentific side, I check my critic, logic analysis and discursive thinking at the door, try to connect again with once-swpet-under-thecarpet 's child innocence, hence to explore and discover like a child. I'm not meant to be an anti-intellectual. When driving and wating at the crossroad for green light, you can't say, " hey , red is not red, green is not green so let's go", then it would not only hurt you but also hurt others.  However it would be perfect and suitable for me to walk in the park and look at the green leafs and red flowers,  and do an experiement of dropping that "red is red, green is green" judgetment or concept or categorization, just  see the things behind its names and labels, feel its essences in a direct way. It is at my disposal, at anytime I could stop and revert.

One of that expieemnt is also about trying to distract my sons' attenion from his mom. I saw a couple of times when he had a pen and he just freely draw himself. I thought why not doing basic idiotproof hand pencil drawing togather.  Well quickly I could hear a voice inside my head, whisperring "Screw you, just recall, through you life, you have no aesthetic cells at all, no taste. Come on,you're a programmer, not a designer, you are just good at playing 01. You dont' that have crazy hairstyle or unique lookings. No artistic temperament. Don't be childish".  Yeah, but this time I thought " whatsoever, I give a shot". We start drawing with his favorite animales. Sometimes, he would collect different leaves of trees to show to his mom, later we would sit togher and just oberve the texture and the lines and sahpes of those leaves and draw it on the paper.

It is a intersting expeirence - two human being are playing and sharing and connecting. There is sopme vibrations.

Those drawings by any academic standards or socaliy standards, wouldn't be considered art. But I feel it is the art, as for me art is about epxressing oneself honstly and be authetical showing what he sees and feels with his heart in life. Art is not fxied or limted to some labels or titles or jobs, it is limitless and it is everywhere in everybody.



## Creativtiy 

As I build up those expeirements, one thing starts to emerge and keep hitting on me.  That's when I do one activity, e.g Active A, and I bump into a wall, sth like writer's block, where you feel you have nothing to say about and feel no clue how to move on.  You're kinda in a mess and have no insiprations, like a stream gets drained.

Instead of forcing it with my will the hard way, to keep banging at the wall, I notice life leads you to next thing with smooth transition.  It is when you got stuck, maybe the sun is good outside, so you go out take a walk; maybe it is raining, weird enough that you want to feel how subtle the rain dropped on your face like what every child would do at the first time;  maybe it is lunch time, you go out to grab some food; maybe your kids just invite you to play and you play; maybe your friend ask you out; maybe you are sitting to long and your body remind you to get some exercise like fishing or play basketball or jogging.  I know it sounds conry、cliche and very subjective like a faith healer. Yep, I do feel It always offers something or activities of different parts of life  to move next.

I stash those things about ActivityA, and go fully blankslately into what comes next. Later when I came back to ActivittyA,  to my surprise, most of time, I just have some different views spontaneously. It wont' directly solve my problem at hand, or guareetend to bring inspirations, but I found it is interesting to play with differents views, and usally it brings new dimensions that I never got into before and just free to explore.

It seems the nature is sorting through those raw unfiltered gathered informations in the background without our knowing. It merged those new with our existings one like an alchemist.  It just connect with different dots, different aspect of life, just a childis drawing and exploring, in a mind-blowing form.  Then all I need to do is  just: "Trust the Process" .

But sometimes I think:  "How you do know it? How sure you are? What's your proof" ?

Well, it is just my gut feeling. It is some beyond the conviction, faith, beilife. I'm giving it all and just aligning and flowing with it, no expectations or attachments. 

But I will do my part of trying to keep my window open, to set up my antenna high on the roof,  to pick up any signals that  nature is sending to me.  Along with that, I collect unfilter informations from expericences in my life and send it back. Nature is doing his part of orgnatizing and comes up with sth new - originality. I dont' borther about my originality, or try to preconcevied or by any effect to try to control it, because any form that would destroy it. I will do my part, and origianlity will take care of itself , thereby me. It is like a tacit agreement. 

The abliity to connect different parts, sth seemingly unrelated on the surface. it is the nature who has greatest and most primordial source of creativity.

I could get in touch with in in the lens of  expericence of those diverse aspect of the life. The gems are scattered  in the most mundane of our daily life. 

Many artistists claimed that they have or had experice using drugs as a source of inspriations and creacitivyt, even the biggest one. Well, here is I thought: when you are in state of  craving:  "it feels good, I need more; I have a tight schedule, I need get it done i beforexxx, so just give it to more; I need sold 2 millions copys; I need it to get into top 100 of billboard; this one is good, I need make next one more impressive" and try force upon your will on that,  it literally just closed all windows for themeselves and pushed the that connection away. They will take shortcut, esp in easily accessabile enviroment, to use drugs to desperately throw themself into that delusion, hoping to get what they fancy about.  Eventually the cheat has to pay its toll. Not only losing the sobriety , also damamgint their body and brain in inreversible way, most importantly,it breaks the tacit agreements,  they could have lost the connection via other ordinaly life experices. The relap is boudn to happen, that is a dead end.

The inner boundary and inner compass is sth, we , as human being,  have been gifted by nature. But we gradually lose it during the growing up. It bring peace, tranquility and freedom.  The boundary is setup voluterenyly and spontainteyly, not out of one's desire or wills, nor out of society rules. I'm not saying to explore the flaws of laws, like what Wall Streets and Crypto world (except Bitcoin) does, but the laws and the moral code of public may get stale, rigid and out of date, the one's inner one is always flowing and up to date.



## What connects with people is you connecting yourself

I have to clarify a little bit here: the things I refer to above like the essential truth or fundamental principles or objective realtity or natural or universe or alchemist, whatever you name it and label it, all points to something behind it.



图片  Deus sive Natura, nature, universe, the tao, god, first principle of zen, Flying Spaghetti Monster (将手稿草图，用尝试用chatgpt4 or other AI生成简单的示意图)



The thing behind is something coudn't put into words. It might be interpreted as an intuition of  "Oneness", "Void", "Emptyness", "Unity" or "Substance". But those would limit it, as if it is only related to religion.  It is above human language yet not isolated from our daily life. No complicted jargons or fancy spritual words need put here. Anyone or anythign could look up to the sky right above them could get it. Therefore, the word "universe" is more common and relatable for anyone regardless of its background/ethitiy/color/nationlitiy, and will be used in following part of this article as reference to that inexpressable、indescrible, incomprehnsible, infitely thing not by its literal meaning in science.

THere is an ineresting story from Chuang-tzu 庄子, 530BC in China。庄子·逍遥游 whom is the philosopher of Taoism.

> 而独不闻之寥寥乎？山林之畏隹，大木百围之窍穴，似鼻、似口、似耳、似枅、似圈、似臼，似窪者，似污者；激者、謞者、叱者、吸者、叫者、譹者、宎者、咬者；前者唱于，而随者唱喁；泠风则小和，飘风则大和；厉风济则众窍为虚；

It says: There are thousands of thousands of holes in the mountains with different shapes. Some look like a nose, some look like a mouth, some look like an ear, with different internal structures. When the wind is blowing on the earth, either small or strong, those holes generate different sounds, each with a unique pitch and tone. In whole, it is as if nature is conducting a symphony or orchestra. How harmonious it is!

图片 风吹百翘

Each hole has different internal structure, some may looks messy, some may looks perfect, but when each hole is self-asserting itself, each is contributing its one into that grand melody. Though different and diverse, each has its root in that shared harmony from universe. Those individuals are somehow connected in their deepest level. When each is expressing themselfves, quite counterintuiltily they dont' have specfic aim for that harmony, or not exist in their head, that's never part of their initial drives, it is all about themseves. 

Suprisingly, when one is express his seeing and feeling about universe in his unfilterd lens in his own way, the universe seems could better connect to the deeply side of others. To awake the true authentica side of someone, to let him could make his own sounds,  no-pretenius, no-duplicating. Hence connect as whole and feel that flowing of the harmony.

Dont seek to copy what someoens does, dont seek them, seek what they're seeking, what they are after.  Don't concentrate on the finger, instead on what it is pointing to - the moon, the universe, the harmony,the one posses greatest source of creativy, inspriation, beauty and compassion.

John Mayer put it beautifully in one of his speech: What connects with people is you connecting yourself.



## Midlife Crisis

The middle life crisis, if I don't identify myself with it, If I just leave the ego part aside, could be an interesting thing to look at. That the overwall evironemnt is not friendly in tech market, you need provide steady bread on the table, your energy and body condition is decliiing, those are the reality with no denial. There are some implications : what if career is not about some fixed path, waht if the finanace is not about linear progression, what if body conditionling is decline but is getting more efficeint at the same time?

Life awalys providers you something new. And those are great times  to challenge some long-hold ideas or assumptions or impressions. To peel off the ego, artificallity and prentence, to go on a drect face-to-face conversaction with the naked self. It is just a play in a different form.

Anyone who try and pratice basic punch, would understand that instead of just focusing on use fist or hand and being rigid,   it is actually a flow and sequnce of invovelment of pretty much whole body.  The power starts with legs from the groud, then the hips and core, back and shoulder then to your arm and fist. That different msucles engates and do its own work, they know when to be flexible and when to be focus, and as a result, it provice maximam pwoer with efficient body mechanic. The body seems to know how to corrdinate and express it in tis nature way as one whole of indispensable and indivisible. This is same for shooting basketball. The most of power to throw the ball is not mainly from arms and hands, rather it is from legs ,hip and core.

In sports, I start to do expierements in which I commit myself to let mind go somwhere recess to take a break, and let the body to reveal itself , to be the protagonist. Let him works in his own way. That also starts to apply to my mind in other areas. With more awareness and pratices, I foudn that I'm able to get into that flow/zone state and have that kind lazer focus more often.

That's a hell lot of fun in this process.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying we shouldn't do planning, but that planning itself requires a prerequisite to living fully in the present moment. Therefore not being attached to the outcome of the planning, not identifying oneself with it. Anytime, anywhere, we are playing, experiencing, flowing, and being. At any moment, we are already self-sufficient.

Just think about: the midlife crisis is actually not that big crisis comparing to following one.  In this digital world, the Brave New World, where the tranditional values were wrecked,  there is a  huge void there. Some products developed with sophisticated algorithrim and  designed with attracting interactive ui/ux are built to only exploit the dopmaine of its users and get them hooked. Those are the most intellectual people with a very deep understanding on the sceicne of  psychology, dopamine system, and how human braiwns works. Those activities keep someone busy so that they dont' have time to face or think of that void and lonelness. Another would be to create an image of idea self on the internet and get other people adirming or envying, all shiny, bling bling,  facny life,   it make them feels good and hooked , and it seems to be a sign of indicating someone has foudn that his/her success. 

[Thanks to the Internet, I have probably seen more naked ladies than all of my ancestors combined. : Showerthoughts (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2cjnmc/thanks_to_the_internet_i_have_probably_seen_more/)

To deal with easiy-acdessible stumuls or additaciotn, to fil lthat void, to find ones' real vocation,  one can't just soly rely on one's will and seeking some silver bullet from outiside.  It is  like spring, the more you press it, the higher it would bounce back hence hurt yourself. We need connect to something bigger than us. That is  by tapping into that flowing stream of universe in our unique way, we possible would find ourself in a senrenity/preace and clam state, no matter how short time it is, it would be able to allow us to see beyhond the ego and identy, to poke throught those sneaky artificiality tricks to connect us with life in reality  again in  a brave way.

The more nosiy it is , the more obvious the quietude would be. Maybe this big crisis could also offer us a great time to reveal more about ourselves. 

We are always the humble of students of the universe. Kid are maybe the most cloest metaphorical symbol to the universe. In one way, kid is alway greatest teacher. As he is learning to learn, I'm learing to unlearn;  As he is learning to do plus, I'm learning to do minus.

Let that crisis just be another play.

## AI

2023 would be the year of AI.  With the ermge of ChatGPT, that are some code interpreter also like the LLM based code interpretors like Microsoft's Coilpot.  I basically use those two a lot in my daily codings, it helps remove some tedious boring trivias codings, no need for stackoverflow or google, reduce the cognitive workload. Something like fine.dev and sweep.dev, even allow product manager to be able do some junior developer level changes in a chat way. It basically read the codebase, plan the changes and write issue and generate pull requests.  For example, there are times when product manager needs to change some text or colors displayed on website, he could directly tell the AI and generate code changes, even auto trigger deployment process on CI.  This could be done without developer. Even thought it is still quite limited and only could do very simple and basics, and the demo looks fancy but not good  in real world battleground codebase,  it shows some potentials.

There are some worries that if it could do some junior developer coding, then later it would be able to senior developer coding, and programmer would face  a crisis of being replaced by AI.

That reminds of the Luddite Movement in early 19th-century England when the textile workers sabotage the emgering machinery who textile workers would think it would steal their jobs and perceived as  threats to their livelihoods. They have a strong concern and fear that he introduction of those automated and mechanized technologies would lead displacement of traditional skilled workers, declinning wages and worse working conditions.

As Industry revolutions move forwards, and introduction of pipeline, the workers has turned into "screws" in the machinery of product line.  In the movie  "Modern Times" of Charlie Chaplin in 1936，the portray of of small indivuiuals in the face of gaint machines shows the repetitive and dehumanizing nature of work. Man has percieved as  merely a tool and an instrument for the end, rather than its value as a human being.

Man is a slave to  the machinery, just as it was a slave to the God before the Humanism Movement of the 15th century.

//agustine - curoisty and three vices of lusts

Prior to Humanism Movement , the nature of fallen sinful, from Middle Ages that human should awalsy remember to be humble and consious of his  mierseral and despicable  being watched by this patriarchal and angry God father. He deservers it and should live in the fear of the Law and at the mercy of the God's grace.  Now Pico Mirandola in his "The Oration on the Dignity of Man"  boldly and loudly says,  like a lighting in the dark night,   that human being has its freemdom,  is marviersous and splendid as a creature on its own,  hence as a human being, as an individual  he should focus on value and free will. 

> We have made you a creature neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, in order that you may, as the free and proud shaper of your own being, fashion yourself in the form you may prefer. It will be in your power to descend to the lower, brutish forms of life; you will be able, through your own decision, to rise again to the superior orders whose life is divine (Mirandola, 8)

 How strikingly similar it is.  Human being is above machiliary, is above tools, of course it is above the AI.

The fundamentail part is just , as a human being, who has free will , how could he explore and find something unqiue about himself, something with emoitional content, stomething with authenticity and genniune, something with creativeity and orignality. 

Certaily as devleoper,  from my 13 years expericen, by observing myself and other devlopers in the trench, I found that some devleopers could easn't fall into the trap of being identify too much with one specif language and techstack. It is like someone could'nt finish the listening when somebody speaks,  as there are so many inner chat and judgements in their head. The mind has been jammed up and not be able to be flexiable to learn something new. Therefore becoming stagnant and fixed techquniuelly. 

> To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.



Also coding is not just being alone with comupters. It epxands more human and life expieer.ce. The code should work best to take full power of machline in a logic way, at tsamt time the idea behind should be  simple and straightford for people to grasp. It is also about balance, about art rathern soly being logic. To be agile is to embracing the changes, knows when to rely on verteran expierces, and when to think out of the box. there are some good p[races:  to pull oneself from the that little screen, 1 to explain to colleages ro someone , as it faoce you to jump out whatever cntext are you in and think from high level and starts basics  2; go out take a talk, have cupe of tea or ocffee, do some stretch etc and do it fullheartedly with any bordering of the previosu problem.  

It opossible you got some different ideas or perfecive when return to the desk. It might pull you out of the details and trust the big whole life (aka universe) would shed some light on you. Rule of thumb: when you feel stuck,  try pause and jump out of that tiny space and try something different.

Maybe programmer is not all about programming or coding,  is some part of life as a broader scope. The line between work or coding and other parts of life is not that clear, and there is some connection between them.  In order to get most out of our ratinliaity and reasoning, one seemingly ridiculous way is to suspend those desires and thoughts for a while. To play and engage without being a salve to any specifc form or style or convention, just to flow like water and be free and unlimited.

With that said, If I have my mindset prepared, and content I want to express, then with the help of emerging technology like AI, it could open up a lot of possibilities.  Prompt engineering to tweak input to get detailed and sepcific request as if it is assgiend with some role,  to AI hence get optimial result；Assistants to fine tunning and let it become your personal agent; AutoGen and LangChain to extend LLM with extenal copmonents and make creating LLM-driven applications easier.

If I'm a designer and doesn't know any code, I could quickly get my MVP up and running with the help of AI; If I come into something new, I could ask AI to get a quick summary and key breakdown to get an overview. Both are very good starting points to begin with. The entry barriare is lowered and more accessrisable to people. However, on the contray , we shouldn't  mistake the tool for the content or the purpose itself.

There is a delicate balance between humanity and tools. Tools won't steal the thunder of the content; instead, they assist in delivering and expressing it in a natural way where care and empathy of human being are best presented. The uniqueness of content is embedded in the uniqueness of the form that facliicatedy by the new tools like AI.

There is one side - that is human , another is the tools. If the tools like AI could remove the barrier for knowlege sharing, then i means the status of human is acutally riased up just like what happened in Humantrism movement.

Human are end-in-itself, not means.



In the digital era, and AI, 对比， 人文主义是将人身上被GOD套的锁链中解脱出来，人得到解放；而现在是传统瓦解value崩溃，个性得到极大的解放，人与人通信变得轻而易举，但是社会撕裂和人们之间相互隔离缺加重了，却都掉进虚无主义陷阱，只能用多巴胺娱乐来麻痹自己，同时将自己困在了rat race中，人某种程度是解放，却要套上另外的枷锁。而

The humantrism revivement is the one how could we aawake the inen self , to reconnect as one in his informationoverload digital era. Human are end-in-itself, not means.  人要从工具化中解脱出来，找回人的本身，找回人的生活体验，找到孩提时代那种探索，回归那种物我归一。（张孝祥过洞庭）



## Summary

A crisis, on the other hand, could leads me to have doubts, and evokes a multitude of  questions about myself and be a great guide. I found that if I dont' reject negative feelings nor try to hold on to positive feelings, I'm in a better position to recieve the subtle messages universe whispers.  as 贺拉斯 暴风雨, not only I rest well instorm, but also I'm not cling to  the sunshine in sunny days.  I mean it is always there, and it is just that I rejected the inner child and closed off the inner light, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and turn to seek from outside, for a long time. Now I feel that life is more about art and the subconscious than just being a logical/rational calculator and conscious. Still, it doesn't need to be mystic, abstract, regional, and spiritual; just something I could access in my ordinary daily routines, nothing special.

We are all still children inside our hearts, aren't we?  Life is a play.



=========

To more concrete and relatable as a pragrammer,  from my 13 years expericen, by observing myself and other devlopers in the trench, I notice some commonly mistakes. 

Some are getting used the languages or tech stack they're using for long time, it is true they gained more insight, but at the same time, some are getting over-idnetify with it.  To some extent, when learn something new like new langage, they wouldn't even able to finish the "Getting Started" part because there is a inner chat constantly whispering in their head "This is bullshit, the syntax is wierd,  the last page is full of right parenthesis?  see, my lanugage is the best".  Basically they setup a cage for themself, as if it provides a sense of secruity and safety, and says "it is the best cage in the world". They could't dump out the water in their filled cup, and be a child to just play with new techniques. Therefore becoming stagnant and fixed techquniuelly.

There are some steretypes about programmer that they're better work with matchines with binary bytes. They are introverts and nerd. The playing video games is their only recreational hobby. Well it speaks some part of the truth, but not all. Coding is not isolated from other part of life, and requires communications between people.  We write in code with high-level human reable language and the code itself needs to fit how human cogitive process works. Like draing a tree, from root to trunk, branch to leaves, thinking also in terms as if someone is gonna read and maintain your code. plus hit writer block , go out or explain to someheres. to boserver what teousa part about other opeopel , not jstu ddevleo, but ctest, developer, . amyabe not limited to that, could be extend to fishing or wather soever.



If a programmer was given a task or feature to develop, he is thinking from high-level to low-level, just like when I draw a tree - it starts with root, then trunk , then branch, and lastly the leafs.  That's how human ingest information.



I hate to say I have mentioned a lot of times about "play" and "kids". but yeah inside ourself, w're walayw skids, an know to play, we're not slave to any specif form , we're unlimited.



if we sort outhe humannity part, the content part of, then nex tis about ai , ehcuiq e and ootls

AI 的好处 降低门槛 带来非常多的可能 比如语言

kid pull the cryon bo and try every color and comination play with it. to see how it epress his feeling.





//That huge low moments and even depressive feeling after the //dopamine hit, the dopmaine rehabilitation , could bring up //some of the most harsh questions for oneself: "What the fuck am I //doing? I can't belive i did it again."  Then one have a //relapse. That just completely crushed all ther feeling or expeiernces of //enggaging other activies of life.

//But that sheer amount of inner judgement and self doubting acculated over this vicious circle could be a clue from universe  to //show where the cure is. To 

//I'm ok. that much senreity , peace and calmnity , and confidence all and all.
