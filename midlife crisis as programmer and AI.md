# midlife crisis as programmer and AI

#### intro:

midlifecrisis 定义： 年龄35-45，上游老下有小，看似稳定的生活包括然后收入可能随时被打破，但是一些年形成的自我良好的变成了思维定义，失去了某种对于生活的激情。社会上主流的Prescribed timetable and social nuns, and expectations 像钳子一样，给你打来安全感同时某种程度我们失去了自我反思反问。

在我的场景：35马上36岁，程序员在中国可能是一个尴尬的年龄，并没有光鲜的履历。没待过大厂，是比较容易收到冲击的，特别是疫情之后的全球的经济形势，特别是自从2023年。

还有一件事便是AI的发力，2023年的Chatgpt大语言模型的兴起，从某种程度上冲击了很多职业，当然程序员也是其中之一。

这些都使得人处于一种比较焦虑的心态之中。



## Myself tech background(Real intro)

Just any ordinal programmer, I studied Software Engierneering major in university. After graduate from university at 2010,  I worked almost two years in Thoughtworks as agile consultant -mostly ruby on rails web development and scrum agile stuff. Then I thought mobile devleoper is kinda cool and why not a give shot? Joined a small mobile development team at ReignDesign, focus on iOS development, some android though. 5 years later, the company moved to chile and I joined a current company to take role as Tech Leader, kinda like full tech (web/backend/infra) and what's interested me is that I want to know how to shift from developer/coder to different role that involve manage not self but whole project and people as whole.

If I say I'm a really really good and top developer, that would be bragging; If I said I'm not good developer, I would be lying and not be honest. 

Every transition went on good for me as I'm quick learner and keep adjusting and still have a passion for tech and coding. Not to say I'm that eager learner like that "Seven language in seven weeks" ,  but it is natural for me to browse some new techs and just play with it.

In 2021, back when the FED is printing tis money and every tech copmany looked like expanding and hiring, I got reached by some companies. The first one is Facebook London, and the coding is horriable. I haven't taken any serious interviews for a long time before that and barely know how the current tech interview process looks like.  The first time it failed and gave me a shock. Then I sit back and quickly gather around my head , did some search and take a full review on the tech interview process and work up from basics for leetcode and system design. Behaviorial  is never a problem for me. In about around four weeks, I praticed hard on algorithms and designs  in my spare time,  and surpisingly refreshed some expierence I had in real-world and learned something now. Then tried with Booking, and it didn't go every smooth. But I grow my expiercen , then later nailed two offers from CloudKitchen and Flexport. CloudKitchen is pretty cool, but kinda mysterious and the vesting plan hmmm.  Flexport wasno't that attractive. I guess tech company need just spend those money out to get more money, and the payment is good. Well, in the end, given my family reasons and I wasn't really looking for jobs initially, so I turned down those offers. When facebook reached second time, I told them that I was't intersted.  So I stayed in my curent company.

What goes up must come down. At the end of 2022 and 2023, the global economy is keeping slow down.  The big 4 tech is doing massive layoff.  Not just tech ,other industries also have start to cut their spending. And it hits China too.  Once fulled LinkedIn message inbox also is almost empty. What's even worse is that the clients of current company has lower or even complete remove the budget.  

I'm 35 and turn into 36 now. The reason about 35 being sesntive age in China is that if you wanna work for gov to take stable job, you need take civil service examination which has some age limit of 35 even though not on paper. So that door is closed. In the a developing country,the social is changing pretty fast and there are plenty of young people coming out college every year since the opening entyr of colleage in 2000. The unemployment rate of young people is pretty high. In fact most big tech companies,  intersnity of work is so high and there is 996 work culture which employees often work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, much like Japan's 80s. There is widely consus of 35 crisis for programmer, you could see lots of posts on this topic about aniexty and confusions in the popular Chinese programmer forum: ([site:v2ex.com/t 35岁 - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:v2ex.com/t 35岁#ip=1)).  Someones can't help says: "is food delivery and  ride-sharing  is the final job of 程序员的最终归属是外卖？滴滴" [大龄程序员的出路难道是开滴滴送外卖吗 - V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com/t/1002227)

Yep, that's what I'm facing. I might lose my current job in a short time and not gonna find another job soon. All that years that built with kinda good feeling of "I'm a good programmer, and everyting under control" now it is like a blowing ballnoon who get  bigger and bigger, sunddely  got pierced and that sound is so big that leave your head buzzing.  A curve ball thrown by life, and those senses of comfort, safety and secruity dissoves in a blink of eye.

That really hurts. 

## The cure

There is a ruler from socialtiy and us that could measure our outside masterial success. Those metric are visible and we're used to measure ourself by it since we grow up.  We want to go higher in that rank(You know the rat race?), so we could feel safer and better. That's subcconusoly becomaes part of ego and we dientify ourself with it. 

(图片Ruler)

Now by this ruler, I'm sliding to bottom part of, fearing of being elimited by KPI。That part of ego and identitiy starts working aginst me it triggers a chain of negativity, connected with deeply some worst memories and emotions in my life, leads to a serisouly self-doubiting as it desperately try to get out this bottom part as soon as possible.

That self doubt has put me to review my whole life. 

I start to ask "Who am I? Did I really love what I do ?"  Along recents years, i have some of best and deeply connected fmaily relatives passed away,  they passed away suddenly and fastly, that I thought or expected  they are gonna be there forever, and now suddenly gone. 人生无常， that leavs your in pondering "how fragile is life and how small/tingy human is". Hence I want to see through that outside ruler, material, scoails nuns, strip out those superficials, in the raw form, "who am I " and "What I really love to do".  That love is not to meet other people's expection, not for vanity, not for fame, not for money, not for fame, not to compare. None of it, but I have a intuituion/hunch that the answer must lies, not in the outward, but in the question itself.

//orign of life, 这样引出我对小孩的玩的观察。

I'm bothered. Life goes on. I have a almost three-years-old kid. My wife and I live away from our hometown of both, and rent some house here and we, as what we called in china, has another role  " teammates"  to take care of our kid. My kid just like to stick to his mom always.  When my teamate need do some her own things, like taking shower or go out shopping, I need ensure I could look after the kid without crying out for mom :)  That's a hell challenge, I need to distract him but watching this favoirte Pepper Pig, Bamboo Club or dinosaurs wont' last long, I have to actively engate with him through activities.Sometimes I take him to kids park（儿童游乐场） or park, sometimes just play with toys and do sth handle pencild drawings at home. 

It is one oridinary playing, my son sitting there to  playing with his 积木, and I'm lying aside and just wathcing him play. I could see he is fully engaged in the playing, his genius and dedicate expression in his face as if time has freezed and the world around him vanished. I feel sth (affections) just draws me and resonate sth once familliar and deeply inside me -  the serenitigy and joyment.  That heals and in that space and timepirod, I was free from all kinds anxiies, fear nor  happniess, any desires.  I dont' want to sounds  conry like revelations like any religon's mystistics like MatinLuther's thunder nor Pascal's near death on one ride, but it just like there is a glowing at his background. That glowing just wakes up my inner child and empowered me.

//basket or fishing

It reminds me of those similar sparks I had during playing basketball and fishing. In some intensive situations, I found that I was able to dropped out my preconceoinved my best moves to attack my opponent. In a blink of eye, my mind looks like hasn't got a chance to spin up and plot some plans,  it is a natual and instinct moves just coming out me. That move is totaly unexpected yet smooth. The oppnonet is like a dancer copmanision. we dont' figiht agianst each other, isntead we dance togother. There is not “me”  in this picutre, the hook, and oponent and my body  are just harmousoly blend as one. That is a amazing, wonderful, indescribable experience.

I notice that my son is playing without fear of being judged by what final result should be, without instilled with how it should be played, not to meet somenoes' expxectation or approval,  not to follow social  nuns, above those dulity of good/bad and past and future. 

sth that we could all related, but that's who we were in child time.  Kid knows how to play, they're born with gift to just play, to explore, to discover.  

maybwe think they haven't devleop high level consicuosu , hence only with subsoncious and aninmal spritit,  but man concious have gone too far and burden me so much as I grows, it just overwhlem all others. I forgot that play is just simply for sake of play.
